Before jumping in the deep end and discussing the nuts and bolts of photography, let's take a step back.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/01-intro.jpg'/><br><br>Technically, photography is an easy subject to master. There are lots of subtleties, of course, but as we will see in the next few weeks, the basics are straightforward. Of course, it will require a fair amount of practice and experimenting on your part to really internalize what you have learned, but taking sharp, well exposed images is not very difficult.<br><br>On the other hand, photography is art. Creating an image that follows your personal vision is a much, much harder task. This is not something that can be transmitted by someone else or learned from a book or a webpage. There is no shortcut, you will have to go through this process yourself. The best I can do, and this is what we will be attempting in this course, is to give you the tools to turn this vision into a concrete image you can share with others. We will do this by progressively moving away from the automated modes of the camera, putting you, the photographer, in charge.<br><br>One more thing about auto modes: there is no shame in using them. Sometimes, they are the right choice for what you want to do. All I really want is for you to have the option not to use them and to really understand what they do and when they are useful. Again, it's all about having the right tool for your purpose.<br><br>Gear is important, and having the right camera or lens can sometimes make all the difference, but it is far too easy to mistake the tree for the forest. Buying better equipment will not make you a better photographer, it will merely enable you to shoot in more conditions. If you are not satisfied with your pictures, there are very good chances the problem is you, not your camera. In particular, any DSLR will do the job more than adequately, and, with a few exceptions, only pro shooters will really benefit from upgrading to more expensive bodies. If you have a DSLR, a micro-4/3 or an advanced compact camera (easy test: does it have P,A,S,M along with the usual scene modes?), then you will be all set. Try to resist the temptation to buy more gear and get to really know what you already own.<br><br>Finally, let's remember to have fun. Photography is amazing but, like any art form, it can also be very frustrating. The worst thing that could happen to you would be to try too hard, burn out and start believing that \"serious\" photography is too hard. It's not, it's just that you are forgetting to enjoy yourself. So, to avoid this, here is the most important instruction I can possibly give you: if at any point you realize that you are bored or frustrated, give yourself a break. Shoot for fun, in auto mode, and rediscover the simple joy of creating pictures. Or don't shoot at all for a while. Stop thinking about photography and come back when you are ready. It's perfectly ok, I do it all the time and so do most professional photographers. They wouldn't last very long otherwise.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/01-intro-2.jpg'/><br><br>"

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "We'll start this class with a rather gentle introduction, by asking ourselves what a camera really is, and what its different components are. Chances are that you will already know some of this, but going through it anyway will at least ensure that we have defined a common vocabulary.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/02-camera.jpg'/><br><br>Shadows in the streets of Copenhagen.<br><br>In the strictest sense, it is simply a device which can record light. It does so by focusing light on a photosensitive surface. From this simple sentence, we can see the three main parts of any camera.<br><br>The photosensitive surface reacts to light through either a chemical process (film) or an electric one (digital sensor). There are fundamental differences between these two, which we will cover in a subsequent lesson, but for now we can consider both of them to be identical: they are a grid of several million tiny dots (pixels) and each can remember how much light it received in a given period of time. There are three important qualities to each sensor: resolution, size and what we can call \"quality\".<br><br>Resolution is simply the number of pixels (it is slightly more complicated with film, let's forget about it for now). The more pixels you have, the more fine grained details you can theoretically record. Any resolution above 2 or 3 megapixels (i.e. millions of pixels) will be enough for displaying on a screen, but higher resolutions come into play for two important applications: printing and cropping.<br><br>In order to have a good reproduction quality, it is generally estimated that between 240 and 300 pixels should be used for every inch of paper (dots per inch, or dpi), which will give a natural limitation to the biggest size one can print. For instance, a 6MP image of dimensions 2000x3000 pixels can be printed at a maximum size of 12.5x8.3\" at 240dpi (2000/240 = 8.3, 3000/240 = 12.5). It is possible to print bigger by either lowering the dpi or artificially increasing the resolution, but this will come at a serious loss of image quality. Having a higher resolution allows you to print bigger.<br><br>Cropping means reducing the size of an image by discarding pixels on the sides. It is a very useful tool and can often improve composition or remove unwanted elements from an image. However, it will also decrease resolution (since you lose pixels), so how much cropping you allow yourself will depend on the initial resolution, which you want to be as high as possible. This is also what some cheaper cameras call \"digital zoom\", which use should be avoided as the plague, as the same effect can very easily be reproduced in post-processing, and the loss of image quality is often enormous.<br><br>The physical size of the sensor is very important and will have an impact on many other parameters, most of which we will see in subsequent lessons: crop factor, depth of field, high ISO noise, dynamic range are some of them. Bigger sensors will also allow to have more widely spaced pixels (increasing image quality) or more of them (increasing resolution). Bigger is almost always better, and this is one of the main reasons that DSLRs (and medium format cameras) produce much better images than compact cameras. In tomorrow's lesson, we will cover the different types of cameras in more details.<br><br>Finally, sensor quality is harder to quantify, but it refers to how well the sensor reacts to difficult light conditions: either low light which will require to increase ISO and for which we want the sensor to have as little noise as possible, or high contrast, which will require a good dynamic range to be recorded adequately.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/02-camera-2.jpg'/><br><br>Sunrise from Nevado Yannapaccha, Peru<br><br>The lens is the second component of any camera. It is an optical device which takes scattered light rays and focuses them neatly on the sensor. Lenses are often complex, with up to 15 different optical elements serving different roles. The quality of the glass and the precision of the lens will be extremely important in determining how good the final image is.<br><br>Lenses must make compromises, and a perfect all around lens is physically impossible to build. For this reason, good lenses tend to be specialized and having the ability to switch them on your camera will prove extremely useful.<br><br>Lenses usually come with cryptic sequences of symbols and numbers which describe their specifications. Without going too much into details, let's review some of their characteristic:<br><br>Focal length refers roughly to the \"zoom level\", or angle of view, of the lens. It will have its own lesson in a few days, as it can be a surprisingly tricky subject. A focal length is usually expressed in millimeters, and you should be aware that the resulting angle of view actually depends on the size of the sensor of the camera on which the lens is used (this is called the crop factor). For this reason, we often give \"35mm equivalent\" focal lengths, which is the focal length that would offer the same view on a 35mm camera (the historic film SLR format) and allows us to make meaningful comparisons. If there is a single length (e.g. 24mm), then the lens doesn't zoom, and it is often called a prime lens. If there are two numbers (e.g. 18-55mm), then you can use the lens at any focal in that range. Compact cameras often don't give focal lengths but simply the range, for instance 8x. This means that the long end is 8 times longer than the wide one, so the lens could for instance be a 18-144mm, or a 35-280mm, etc.<br><br>The aperture is a very important concept which we will talk about in much detail later on. The aperture is an iris in the centre of the lens which can close to increasingly small sizes, limiting the amount of light which gets on the sensor. It is refered to as a f-number, for instance f/2.8. To make things worse, it is quite counter-intuitive, as the smaller the number, the bigger the aperture! For now, we don't have to worry about this too much. The important number on a lens is the maximal aperture, the lower the better. Professional zoom lenses often have f/2.8 maximal apertures, and cheaper consumer lenses have ranges such as f/3.5-5.6, meaning that at the wide end, the maximum aperture is f/3.5 and at the long end, it is f/5.6. Aperture can be closed to tiny levels, usually at least f/22.<br><br>Lenses also need a focusing system. Nowadays, most lenses have an internal motor which can be piloted by the camera: the autofocus. They also have a ring to allow the photographer to focus manually. There are plenty of options for autofocus motors as well, for instance hypersonic or silent ones.<br><br>Lenses are increasingly equiped with stabilisation systems (called VR by Nikon, IS by Canon). They detect small movements, usually handshake, and compensate for them by moving internally the optical elements in the opposite direction. Though no magic pills, those systems tend to work very well and allow to take sharp images at quite slow shutter speeds.<br><br>Finally, lenses can have all sorts of fancy options: apochromatic glass, nano-coating, etc, designed to increase the quality of the final image. You probably shouldn't worry too much about those.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/02-camera-3.jpg'/><br><br>Grand Central Station, NYC<br><br>Finally, the body is the light tight box connecting the lens to the sensor, and ordering everyone around. Though some film cameras are just that, black boxes, most digital cameras are now small computers, sporting all sorts of features, often of dubious usefulness. Let's review some of the components found in most bodies:<br><br>The most important is probably the shutter. Think of it as a curtain in front of the sensor. When you press the trigger, the curtain opens, exposes the sensor to light from the lens, then closes again after a very precise amount of time, often a tiny fraction of a second. Most shutters operate between 30 seconds and 1/4000s of a second. That duration (the shutter speed) is one of the three very important exposure factors, along with aperture and ISO.<br><br>A light meter. As the name suggests, it measures the quantity of light and sets the exposure accordingly. How much manual control you keep at this stage is one of the most important questions in photography. There are different metering modes, but except in very specific cases, using the most advanced, most automated one (matrix metering on Nikon cameras) will provide the best results.<br><br>A focus detector, used to drive the autofocus motor in the lens. There are two competing technologies, contrast detection and phase detection, with at the moment an edge for the latter, which explains why DSLRs tend to focus faster than compact cameras. These systems tend to vary greatly between basic and advanced bodies, but it should be noted that they all need reasonable amounts of light to work properly.<br><br>A way to store the image just created. Back in the days of film, this was just a lever to advance the roll to the next unexposed frame. Now, it is a pipeline which ends up in the memory card that the camera is using. If you are shooting jpg instead of raw (more on this in another lesson), there is an additional stage where the internal computer performs all sort of black magic on the image to output a ready-to-view jpg file.<br><br>A way to frame. It can be a multitude of things, optical or electronic viewfinder, LCD screen or even ground glass. Here too, DSLRs have an edge as an optical viewfinder allows \"through-the-lens\" viewing and immediate feedback, while electronic viewfinders (really, a LCD screen inside a viewfinder) and LCDs often have limited resolution and slight updating delays.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/02-camera-4.jpg'/><br><br>Galapagos crabs.<br><br>Assignment<br><br>Take a good look at your camera, whatever its type, and try to identify each component we have discussed here. It might be a good opportunity to dig out the manual or to look up its exact specifications online. Now look up a different camera online (for instance at dpreview) and compare their specifications. Try doing this for both a less advanced and a more advanced body, and for different lenses. Report here if you find any interesting difference, or if some parts of the specifications are unclear."

		content: "Today's lesson will be a continuation of yesterday's. We have talked about the different components of any camera, but not really about the different types of cameras out there.<br><br>We will classify cameras in 5 somewhat arbitrary groups: compacts, EVIL, DSLRs, big stuff and exotics. For practical purposes, you can forget about the last two categories, as anyone using those shouldn't need an introduction class.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/03-cameras.jpg'/><br>Savannah, GA.<br><br>Compact cameras, sometimes also called point-and-shoot probably were your first camera. They are very convenient: cheap, small, light and fool proof. As the name suggests, just point it in the general direction of the subject and press the button. The camera does the rest.<br><br>Their main advantages, as said, is their low profile. They are so small and unobtrusive that you are likely to carry them all the time, and to have them handy when you need them. After all, even the crappiest camera you have with you beats the amazing one you left at home. Their small size is also an advantage when you want to be discreet. Most people will assume you are just a tourist and won't give you a second look, whereas even a small DSLR will attract attention.<br><br>Unfortunately, the downsides are many, as this type of camera will make many - too many - compromises. In particular, the sensor will be very small. This means that low light capabilities are very bad, and images are often unusable from ISO 400 due to noise. Another consequence is that depth of field (the total area in focus, more on this in another lesson) is always huge, which is sometimes a good thing but limits the ability to separate a subject from its background. Except in high-end compacts, lenses tend to be of rather mediocre quality and with limited maximal apertures, which has an impact on image quality, among other things.<br><br>Because they do not use a mirror system like DSLRs, compact cameras use the LCD screen almost exclusively for framing, which is a problem in bright light and is also less pleasant than an optical viewfinder. One of the most annoying characteristics of compacts, however, is the infamous shutter lag - the delay between pressing the trigger and the photo actually being recorded, which varies from half a second to several seconds! It has much to do with the autofocus system being slow, and the situation has gradually been improving, but it still remains one of the main reasons people want to switch to DSLRs, as it is far too easy to miss shots because of it (and is plain frustrating).<br><br>Another annoying thing about compacts is that their designers generally assume the photographer wants the camera to take all the decisions. It is often difficult and impractical, if not impossible, to gain manual control of the various camera settings. Few cameras in particular offer PASM modes instead of scene modes. Many controls are also hidden deep in the menus, making them impossible to modify on the fly.<br><br>Digital Single Lens Reflex cameras (DSLRs) are the \"serious\" camera of choice these days. Though this comes at the price of a serious increase in weight and bulk (and, well, price), they are also much more uncomprimising on everything that matters. In particular, they have interchangeable lenses which allows you to always have the best lens for the occasion. Even APS-C (DX) cameras have big enough sensors to allow shallow depth of field and good low light/dynamic range quality. There is an optical viewfinder, which allows framing in the worst light conditions and is generally more responsive than any electronic screen.<br><br>The annoyances of compact cameras are also gone: shutter lag is virtually unknown, autofocus generally very fast (though this depends on the lens) and even entry-level cameras provide full manual control along with their scene modes.<br><br>There are several different sensor sizes, commonly called \"cropped sensor\" or \"DX\" for the smaller versions, and \"full frame\" or \"FX\" for the bigger ones, which correspond exactly to the size of 35mm film. High end cameras tend to use FX for a variety of reasons, mostly having to do with image quality in difficult light conditions. Concretely, the main difference has to do with the crop factor, which we will cover in tomorrow's lesson.<br><br>In short, as long as you remember to actually bring it with you, a DSLR will be better than a compact in every respect.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/03-cameras-3.jpg'/><br>Homeless man in San Francisco.<br><br>EVIL (Electronic Viewfinder, Interchangeable Lenses) cameras are new hybrids which started appearing in 2008. Most are based on the micro-4/3 lens mount, though Sony's NEX cameras use a different system. The concept is to remove the bulky mirror and pentaprism necessary for the optical viewfinder of a DSLR, but to keep the other capabilities, in particular large sensors and interchangeable lenses. This allows for a drastic reduction in size, putting them closer to compacts than DSLRs.<br><br>Though they are currently limited by the few available lenses, this is a concept that manages to merge the best of both worlds. Whether the sacrifice of the optical viewfinder in exchange for a smaller size is worthwhile will be an entirely personal choice.<br><br>The big stuff refers to bigger than 35mm cameras, which in the digital world means medium format backs. The cheapest start at 10-15k$, without lenses, but their resolution and image quality is hard to beat. They have little interest if you are not printing big, as the difference from high-end DSLRs will be hardly noticeable. They are mostly used by commercial shooters and (rich) landscape photographers.<br><br>Finally, exotics is everything else, including, sadly, all film cameras. Let's take a small tour:<br><br>Large format cameras, the wooden box with bellows and a black cloth to hide the photographer. Their resolution can even beat that of MF digital backs but the large negative size makes everything harder, from buying film to developing and scanning or printing it. They are also a mild pain in the ass to use, though there is a zen side to it.<br><br>Rangefinders are another alternative to DSLRs, where the optical viewfinder does not pass through the lens. This permits a smart manual focus system based on split screens. The most famous of these cameras are the Leica M family, and the last iteration, the M9, is one of the best digital cameras money can buy. Photojournalists and street shooters love them, but their learning curve is steep.<br><br>Holgas/Lomos are very popular with hipsters. Former soviet crappy, light leaking, plastic film bodies with next to no control. They produce images that are technically terrible but have a special look that many people love. They are relatively cheap and fun to play with, so you might be tempted to pick one up.<br><br>Phone cameras - you have them with you all the time. That's about all there is to say.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/03-cameras-2.jpg'/><br><br>"

		sstitre:"Focal length",
		lien: "http://www.alexandrebuisse.org/resources/photo-class/04-Focal-length",
		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "In this fourth lesson, we are (finally!) going to start discussing the meat of photography technique, with a very important parameter: focal length.<br><br>As we saw in lesson 2, focal length is what determines how \"zoomed in\" you are, also often called angle of view. Focal length is an actual length, expressed in millimeters (it corresponds to the distance between the optical center of the lens and the film plane, though you need not worry about that). The lower this number, the less zoomed in you are. We speak of a wide angle, since you can view much on the sides: you have a wide view. Conversely, if the number is high, the angle will be narrow and you will only see a small portion of what is in front of you: you are zoomed in, this is what we call a telephoto.<br><br>Though we will see later that it is not exactly true, as an approximation, you can zoom with your feet: walking 10 meters closer to your subject or adding 5mm to your focal length will result in the same image (these are random numbers, by the way). The choice of a focal length is the very first step in composing a photograph, and probably the most important, as it determines framing. All the other choices (exposure, depth of field, etc) are dependent on your framing having been decided on.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/04-fatima-3.jpg'/><br><br>Descending Nevado Fatima.<br><br>So far, so good. But things become a little bit more complicated when you start looking at the actual numbers. An 18mm lens on a medium format camera will produce a very different angle of view than the same focal length on a compact camera. A modern compact like the Canon S90 has focal lengths between 6.0 and 22.5mm, yet the same values on a lens for a FX DSLR like the Canon 5D would be unbearably wide and totally unusable.<br><br>The culprit is what we call the crop factor. The focal length is a physical property of a lens, but the resulting angle of view, which is what we are really interested in, depends on another factor: sensor size. The bigger the sensor, the wider the angle of view for the same focal length. In order to convert angles of view between different formats, we use the crop factor, which is a ratio between the standard 35mm film area and the actual sensor size. For instance, Nikon DX cameras have a smaller sensor than their FX counterparts, which results in a 1.5x crop factor. This means that a 28mm lens on a DX camera will have the same angle of view as a 28*1.5=42mm lens on FX. This explains why, when DX cameras started appearing, the focal ranges of most lenses changed accordingly: the 18-200mm DX lens counterpart is the (just announced) 28-300mm FX lens, etc.<br><br>Of course, this works in the other direction too: if your sensor is bigger than 35mm film, then you will need longer focal lengths to obtain similar angles of view: on 4x5 large format cameras, 150mm is considered normal, whereas it would be firmly in the telephoto domain on a DSLR.<br><br>Because it can all be a bit confusing, especially with lenses that can be used on several different formats, it is common to give a \"35mm equivalent\" focal length: the focal length which on a 35mm/FX camera would give the same angle of view.<br><br>Concretely, you just need to be careful when discussing actual focal lengths: remember that the final angle of view (which is probably what you are discussing) depends on the crop factor, and that everyone may be using different ones.<br><br>Remember how a bit earlier, I said you could zoom with your feet? Well, it's not quite true. The reason is that perspective will change. One effect of using a long focal length is that it will compress perspective, making everything appear to be on the same plane. Wide angle, on the other hand, will exagerate depth, sometimes to extreme lengths. This is why landscape photographers like to use ultra-wide lenses.<br><br>Compare for instance this image, shot at 16mm (with a 1.5x crop factor):<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/04-focal.jpg'/><br>Will Foreman on The Rasp.<br><br>to this one, at 155mm:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/04-focal-2.jpg'/><br>Aiguille de Blaitiere, Chamonix.<br><br>Notice how in the second one, the moon seems to very close to the mountain, while in the first one, the climber appears very far away from the ground (he wasn't more than 8-10m up)? This is an effect of focal length, and a very important creative tool at your disposal.<br><br>Sometimes, it will be worth getting closer to your subject and using a shorter focal length, if you want to create depth and emphasize perspective. Sometimes, you will have to walk backward and use a longer lens, if you want to compress perspective. You can sometimes see this effect in movies, usually when someone is feeling sick or about to pass out, and the relative position of objects seems to change but the framing remains the same (see this youtube extract from the Goodfellas). This is achieved by moving forward while zooming out at the exact same speed.<br><br>Now that you know more about focal length, let's take a look at the different ranges usually found in lenses, and what their uses tend to be. Of course, there are many, many exceptions, but this is the \"normal\" use they were designed for. All focal lengths are given for 35mm sensor size (crop factor 1).<br><br>Ultra-wide angle - 14-24mm: They are pretty specialized lenses as they will tend to exaggerate perspective to levels which can easily be disturbing. Our eyes are not used to such wide angles of view, and they will look unnatural, which can be used for artistic purposes. Landscape and architecture photographers love these focals as they will create a lot of depth and emphasize perspective.<br><br>Wide angle - 24-35mm: Wide enough to show a lot of context, but not so wide that they look unnatural, they were used a lot by photojournalists. It is a good \"default\" focal range, which explains why most kit lenses include them (18-xx lenses on DX DSLRs, for instance).<br><br>Normal - 40-75mm: What exact length a normal lens should be has been subject to a lot of debate, but it is estimated to be around 45mm. This is an angle of view which looks very natural and \"inoffensive\", neither too wide nor too tele. It also corresponds more or less to the focal length we actually perceive (though due to peripheral vision, our eyes have an estimated 22mm focal). Street photographers love these lengths.<br><br>Mild tele - 85-105mm: This is prime portrait category: long enough to isolate the face and create separation from the background (through shallow depth of field, more on this in another lesson) but short enough that you can still be within communicating distance from your subject.<br><br>Medium tele - 120-300mm: Just like wide angle, this is very polyvalent focal length which can be used in most genre to isolate details and simplify compositions. For landscape work, remember about the \"perspective flattening\" effect.<br><br>Long and exotic tele - 300-800mm: Those are specialized lenses for wildlife and sport photographers who need to get close to their subjects but can't physically move. They are complex and very expensive lenses, and their angle of view is so narrow that it won't be of much use to most photographers. Tripods and fat wallets are often required.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/04-focal-5.jpg'/><br>Standing on the shoulders of giants.<br><br>Assignment<br><br>The assignment today is about getting a bit more familiar with focal lengths. You will need a camera and a zoom lens (or a series of prime lenses). Go somewhere where you can walk freely. Bonus points if there is a mildly interesting subject. Start by staying immobile and take a picture of the same subject at 5mm increments for the entire range of your lens (compact cameras users, just use the smallest zoom increments you can achieve). Now, remember the framing of your most zoomed in image, walk toward the subject and try to take the same image with the widest focal you have.<br><br>Back on your computer, compare the last two images. Do they match exactly? What are the differences? Take the series of immobile pictures, reduce the size of the most zoomed in image and overlay it on top of the widest one. Does it match exactly?<br><br>If you are not tired yet, try taking a wide angle image which emphasizes perspective and a tele image which makes use of perspective compression."

		content: "Welcome to the second part of this photography class. After getting an overview of what a camera is and how focal length works, let's now go on to what is probably the most important and scariest parameter of any photograph: exposure.<br><br>In order to keep things (relatively) short, we will split this vast subject into many small digestible pieces. In this lesson, we will see what exactly exposure is, and how we can use three camera controls to modify it. In the next lesson, we will talk about a very important tool for reviewing exposure: the histogram. In the subsequent three lessons, we will talk about each of the three controls (shutter speed, aperture and ISO) in more detail. Finally, we will discuss the slightly arcane topic of metering modes.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/05-exposure-3.jpg'/><br><br>Climber on Flying Buttress Direct.<br><br>A photograph, as the name suggests, is a record of light. Exposure, quite simply, is the amount of light to which the sensor is exposed. We are all familiar with photos taken indoor without a flash and which appear too dark: they are underexposed, not enough light was allowed on the sensor. Conversely (though perhaps more rarely), we have also seen images too bright, with pure white in large areas: they are overexposed.<br><br>There is not one correct exposure of a given scene - depending on what you are trying to say with your image, you might actually over or underexpose on purpose. For instance, a backlit scene could be underexposed to create silhouettes against the sky. Or a portrait might be carefully overexposed to create a high-key feeling. However, what we will generally consider a good exposure is one with an even (but not necessarily linear, as we will see tomorrow) distribution of tones, from pure black to pure white, with no details lost to either shadows or highlights.<br><br>With the exception of some very manual film cameras, all modern camera bodies include one or several light meters, whose role is to measure the quantity of light and give a guess of what the correct exposure should be. What you will do with this information will depend on the shooting mode you are using: in auto, the camera will simply set all the required parameters so that you can shoot without questions asked. Alternatively, it can let you set one or more parameters and fill in the remaining ones (aperture or speed priority modes), or it can let you do the whole thing yourself, mentioning how your settings compare to what it thinks you should do, but not acting on it (manual mode).<br><br>Three, and only three, parameters control the quantity of light to reach the sensor. They are the usual suspects: aperture, shutter speed and ISO. Let's see briefly how they work with an analogy.<br><br>Imagine that your sensor is a bucket. Light is water coming from a pipe (your lens) into the bucket. What you want to achieve is a good exposure - just the right quantity of water, to the rim but without spilling any on the floor. You can achieve that by doing three things:<br><br>You can change the diameter of the pipe. The wider it is, the more water will come into the bucket (ignoring pressure issues - that's when the analogy starts to break down).<br><br>You can modify the amount during which the pipe is open. Obviously, the longer you leave it open, the more water will come through.<br><br>Finally, the water is not very pure. There is a filter above the bucket to remove impurities. You can decide how fine the filter is: the coarser it is, the more water will go through, but at the price of more impurities making their way into the bucket.<br><br>You can decide to modify any of these parameters as you wish to achieve your perfect bucket, with some limitations of course: for instance, you can't have a pipe of infinite diameter, there is a maximum size. Likewise, your filter can't be too coarse or you might get dead rats in the bucket and it would be unusable.<br><br>Something that is extremely important to realize is that all three parameters are bound together. If you modify one and want to keep the same exposure, you need to modify another in the opposite direction. For instance, if you want to use a pipe with twice as much area (doubling the flow), you need to either cut the flow duration by half or use a twice as fine filter. Modifying a single parameter will result in a modification of the bucket content.<br><br>As you probably guessed already, the diameter of the pipe corresponds to the aperture, the duration to the shutter speed and the filter to the ISO. Things get even more interesting because each of these parameters has another consequence beside modifying exposure: aperture changes depth of field, shutter speed can introduce motion blur and ISO modifies the noise levels.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/05-exposure-2.jpg'/><br><br>Bouldering competition.<br><br>Let's be a little more concrete. When you put your camera in a non-automatic mode (if it has one, if not, you can look at the metadata of old photos to find this information), you should see three numbers in the display, for instance f/8, 1/50, ISO 400 (the ISO is often hidden, you may have to hunt it down in the menus). What this is telling you is that the aperture is f/8, the speed 1/50th of a second and the ISO is 400. What you want these numbers to be will be covered in the next lessons. For now, let's take a look at how modifying them changes exposure.<br><br>Put your camera in A mode. What this does is let you control the aperture and set the shutter speed accordingly. Turn the control wheel in one direction to modify the aperture. You should now see instead f/5.6 (if you turned in the correct direction). What this is telling you is that you are now using a wider pipe diametre and have doubled the flow. What you should notice is that the speed changed as well: now it is showing 1/100, and the ISO hasn't changed. To compensate for the modification of one parameter, the camera changed another one, and kept the same overall exposure.<br><br>If you do want to modify the overall exposure while in a mode other than manual, you should use the aptly named button called \"exposure compensation\". What this will do will depend on the mode you are using, for instance if you are in Aperture Priority, it will change the shutter speed to fill the bucket to a different level, while leaving you in control of the aperture.<br><br>In manual mode, the camera lets you modify all three parameters yourself without attempting to compensate and keep the same global exposure. It will usually let you know how far away you are from what it considers the correct exposure, but whether you want to follow its recommendation is up to you. In this mode, since we have full control anyway, the exposure compensation button is useless.<br><br>This should hopefully give you a good idea of what is going on in a camera brain, and what the A, S and M modes are for, but we have left a lot of things out, to be covered in the next lessons. For now, make sure you have really understood all the concepts here, as they are absolutely crucial for the rest of this course (and of your photographic career).<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/05-exposure.jpg'/><br><br>Food close-up.<br><br>Assignment<br><br>The goal today is to get a bit more familiar with exposure and how it is affected by the main three parameters of shutter speed, ISO and aperture. I am afraid the assignment will require control of these elements. If your camera has no ASM modes or manual controls via menus, you won't be able to complete the assignment, sorry.<br><br>Keeping a single scene for the whole session, the assignment is basically to play with your camera in semi and full manual modes. Make sure to turn \"ISO Auto\" to off. What we will call \"correct exposure\" in the assignment is simply what your camera think is correct. Obtain a correct exposure in full auto, aperture priority, speed priority and full manual mode. Now do the same but with a big underexposure (2 stops, or 2 eV). Same with a big overexposure (2 stops/2 eV again). Get a correct exposure with an aperture of f/8 in aperture priority (easy), full manual (easy-ish) and speed priority (a bit harder). Do the same with a speed of 1/50. Now get a correct exposure with both f/8 and ISO 400 (you can use any mode). Finally, try to get a correct exposure with ISO 200 and a speed of 1/4000.<br><br>Also remember that there are many pieces of software, some free, which allow you to review which parameters were used for the capture. It is always stored in the metadata of the image."

		content: "As we saw in the last lesson, exposure is one of the most important controls of the final image. We have discussed how to modify exposure, but not how to review it. This is the role of a very powerful tool: the histogram.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-histogram.jpg'/><br><br>As a rule of thumb, the LCD screen should never be trusted to evaluate exposure. It is not designed to produce an accurate rendition of the image and how bright your photo appears will depend on a variety of factors, including the ambiant light levels and the brightness setting you applied to the screen. For this reason, you might have the bad surprise of thinking your image is well exposed in the field, only to find out the screen misled you when you get back to your computer.<br><br>A histogram, on the other hand, is a more \"scientific\" way of evaluating exposure, and it will always be available and identical on all devices, whether the LCD screen of your camera or your fancy calibrated computer monitor. All digital cameras offer post-capture histograms - often in one of the \"image details\" modes (check your manual), and some models also have \"live histogram\", a very useful feature showing what the histogram would be if you took the photo at that instant. Since a live histogram is not possible to draw on an optical viewfinder, this is a feature rarely found on DSLRs, however.<br><br>Enough introduction, let's talk about what a histogram really is. Let's consider a black and white jpg file. It is coded in 8 bits, which means that each pixel, each dot in the image, can have any of 2**8 (2 to the power of 8) = 256 values, all different levels of gray. 0 is pure black, 1 is slightly brighter, etc until you reach 255, pure white. Now let's imagine we have a bunch of marbles and a neat series of 256 vertical tubes, neatly arranged in a line. We will go through the image pixel by pixel and look at the brightness of each one. Let's say the first one is pretty dark, around 15: we put a marble inside tube number 15. The next one is a bit brighter, a 20, so we put a marble inside tube 20. The next pixel is also a 20, we put a new marble and now have a higher stack of marbles in tube 20. We do this for a couple of million pixels until we have looked at every individual pixels, then we take a step back and look at our line of tubes.<br><br>If the image was very dark, we will have many marbles in the tubes on the left, between 0 and 50, say, and not so many on the right, bright side. Conversely, if the image was overexposed, the tubes will be very full on the right side and almost empty on the left. And if we have a nice exposure, then all the marbles will be roughly in the middle.<br><br>This is exactly how a histogram is created. Of course, counting millions of pixels and remembering the levels of each tube would take us a good while, but this is the kind of things computers are very good at, and it is virtually instantaneous.<br><br>Here are some concrete examples. You can have one very dark image:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-ex1.jpg'/><br><br>and its associated histogram:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-hist-1_m.jpg'/><br><br>Notice how all the data is shifted far to the left, with almost nothing on the middle and the right side. Also notice that the headlamp beams are too small to be noticeable in the histogram.<br><br>Conversely, you can have a fairly bright image:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-ex2.jpg'/><br><br>with large areas close to white. Its histogram:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-hist2_m.jpg'/><br><br>is shifted to the right, and there is a small bar to the right edge, which means we have lost some details to pure white. In this case, it is ok since this corresponds to a smooth snow surface. This is a good example of when a \"bad\" exposure can also be correct.<br><br>Finally, a more common image:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-ex3.jpg'/><br><br>and its histogram:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-hist-3_m.jpg'/><br><br>showing a nice distribution from pure black to pure white, with nothing too extreme.<br><br>There are several important things to notice. First, unless you have been playing with the image in photoshop, there won't be sharp transitions from 0 to a suddenly high value. Laws of distributions ensure that we always obtain some form of bell curve.<br><br>The histograms makes it very easy to visualize how you control exposure: all you are doing is shifting the entire histogram to the right (if you overexpose) or to the left (if you underexpose). And if you push it too far and hit the edges, something interesting happens: the histogram \"crashes\" and puts all the marbles in the last line, next to the edge: pure white, or pure black. This means that the information is lost forever, and this is something you will usually want to avoid at all costs.<br><br>An ideal histogram, then, is relatively easy to define: it is a bell curve covering the whole width and finishing exactly at the edges, with no lost details. This also happens to be what the exposure meter in your camera will try to produce.<br><br>There are several more advanced points which can be discussed:<br><br>So far, we only talked about brightness, not about colours. Colour information is coded in three channels (Red, Green and Blue, also known as RGB) and some cameras show individual histograms for each channel. This is useful information in one situation: when you have a very brightly coloured object, it is possible to blow out the corresponding channel (go so far to the right that information is lost) without it showing in the main histogram. It is otherwise safe to ignore these specialized histograms.<br><br>For RAW shooters (which we will cover in a while), you should be aware that the displayed histogram is the one from the jpg preview file, not the one from your actual RAW data. This means that you can sometimes recover more information than you think. This is something camera makers could fix relatively easily but refuse to do, for some reason.<br><br>Due to the way information is stored in digital cameras, there are more details in highlights than in shadows. If you plan on using significant post-processing, you should try to shift your histogram to the right as far as you can without getting pure white, then shift it back left in post-processing. This is known as the \"expose to the right\" technique, and it does produce marginally better images.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/06-histogram-2.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>Today's assignment will be relatively short. The idea is simply to make you more familiar with the histogram and to establish a correspondence between the histogram and the image itself.<br><br>Choose a static scene. Take a picture and look at the histogram. Now use exposure compensation in both directions, taking several photos at different settings, and observe how the histogram changes. Does its shape change? Go all the way to one edge and observe how the data \"slumps\" against the edge. Try to identify which part of the image this corresponds to.<br><br>Next, browse the internet and find some images you like. Download them (make sure you have the right to do so) and open them in a program which allows you to see the histogram, for instance picasa or gimp. Try to guess just by looking at the image what the histogram will look like. Now do the opposite: try to identify which part of the histogram corresponds to which part of the image."

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "We saw in lesson 5 that we have three tools to control exposure: shutter speed, aperture and ISO. Of these, the easier to understand and most intuitive certainly is shutter speed, which we will talk about in this lesson.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-speed.jpg'/><br><br>This parameter simply refers to the amount of time during which the shutter is open and the sensor/film exposed. It is usually expressed in fractions of a second, since it will be relatively rare to need durations longer than one second. Obviously, the longer the speed, the more light can be recorded, and thus the higher the exposure. Like everything exposure related, we also talk about stops for shutter speed, which is a relative measurement unit: 1 stop of overexposure corresponds to doubling the amount of light received, so doubling the shutter speed. Of course, 1 stop of underexposure is the opposite, halving the shutter speed.<br><br>At first look, it would appear that it would be simple enough to just let the shutter open as long as you need to obtain a correct exposure, without any other consideration. However, this leads to a problem: what happens when either the subject or the camera moves during the while the shutter is open? We are of course all too familiar with the answer: motion blur. Conversely, using high shutter speeds will result in \"freezing\" the action, recording the exact split second where you pressed the shutter.<br><br>The game, then, is to find a shutter speed which is slow enough that you get enough light, but high enough that you don't get motion blur. In order to achieve this, it is important to find the \"handheld\" limit, below which your images will be blurred. It depends on many factors:<br><br>How fast the subject is moving. Someone walking at a normal pace will usually appear sharp up to 1/50 or so. Sport photographers tend to use 1/500 to 1/1000 as a base speed, sometimes even faster. Here are some examples of fast moving subjects which required fast shutter speeds (respectively, 1/200, 1/1250 and 1/1600):<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-ex1.jpg'/><br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-ex2.jpg'/><br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-ex3.jpg'/><br><br>Which focal you are using. Since details are much smaller in the frame with wider focals, you can get away with slower speeds. Conversely, if you are using a 500mm lens, the tiniest lens movement will appear unacceptably blurry.<br><br>How stable you are. It depends on your age, your physical condition, your training, the weight of your equipment, your position, the way you hold your camera and a myriad of other factors.<br><br>Whether your camera or your lens has some form of stabilisation (called vibration reduction by some). This will usually make you gain 1 to 3 stops (i.e. you can divide the speed by 2 to 8).<br><br>The rule of thumb usually given is that the handheld limit is 1/focal length (in 35mm equivalent). So if you are shooting a full frame camera at 50mm, your images should be sharp at 1/50 and above, as long as the subject is static. On a DX DSLR, the same focal would require 1/75 or so (to account for the crop factor). However, this depends on so many factors that you may well find that your own limit is significantly faster or slower.<br><br>Once you have found what your handheld limit for a particular focal is, all you have to do is make sure you always use faster speeds. Whenever it isn't possible, usually because there isn't enough light, you will have to use a tripod.<br><br>In some cases, however, you will want to use slow shutter speeds. This usually happens in cases where you want to communicate that your subject is moving. The most common case is panning: instead of having a static environment with a blurred subject, you will try to follow the exact movements of your subject so that it is the only sharp thing. It is extremely effective when done well, but takes a lot of practice and trial and error to achieve. This is used often in automobile sports and bird photography. Here is a (not very good) example:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-ex4.jpg'/><br><br>Another popular effect consists in using very slow speeds on moving water, which will result in a dreamy, surreal look. You will need a tripod and probably a neutral density filter to reduce the amount of light entering the lens. A not too extreme example would be this one:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-ex5.jpg'/><br><br>Another more creative example is this image of NYC's Grand Central Station:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/07-ex6.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>The goal of this assignment is to determine your handheld limit. It will be quite simple: choose a well lit, static subject and put your camera in speed priority mode (if you don't have one, you might need to play with exposure compensation and do some trial and error with the different modes to find how to access the different speeds). Put your camera at the wider end and take 3 photos at 1/focal equivalent, underexposed by 2 stops. Concretely, if you are shooting at 8mm on a camera with a crop factor of 2.5, you will be shooting at 1/20 - 2 stops, or 1/80 (it's no big deal if you don't have that exact speed, just pick the closest one). Now keep adding one stop of exposure and take three photos each time. It is important to not use the burst mode but pause between each shot. You are done when you reach a shutter speed of 1 second. Repeat the entire process for your longest focal length.<br><br>Now download the images on your computer and look at them in 100% magnification. The first ones should be perfectly sharp and the last ones terribly blurred. Find the speed at which you go from most of the images sharp to most of the images blurred, and take note of how many stops over or under 1/focal equivalent this is: that's your handheld limit.<br><br>Bonus assignment: find a moving subject with a relatively predictable direction and a busy background (the easiest would be a car or a bike in the street) and try to get good panning shots. Remember that you need quite slow speeds for this to work, 1/2s is usually a good starting point."

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "The time has come to talk about one of the scariest subjects of photography: aperture and f-stops. This is the second exposure control (with shutter speed and ISO) and perhaps the least intuitive.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/08-aperture-05.jpg'/><br><br>Remember our pipe and bucket analogy in the exposure lesson? Aperture corresponds to the diameter of the pipe, which is a straightforward way of controling the amount of water which ends up in the bucket: the smaller the aperture, the less water we get. This is exactly what goes on inside your lens, there is a diaphragm whose open area (in other words, its aperture) can vary, from fully open to almost entirely shut. Controling the aperture is also what your eyes do to adapt to different light conditions: enter a dark room and your pupils will expand to get as much light as possible, or step outside in full sunlight and you will need a few moments for your pupils to shrink enough so that you don't get blinded.<br><br>However, just like shutter speed, modifying the aperture has other consequences than changing exposure. It also modifies depth of field. This is how we call the distance between the nearest object in focus and the furthest in focus, or in other words, how deep the area of focus is. We will discuss it in more details in another lesson, as there are (as always) other factors which affect it. For now, we can just remember that large apertures, which mean a lot of light is hitting the sensor, will create shallow depth of field, where the subject is in focus but the background appears blurred. Conversely, small apertures, limiting the quantity of light we record, will create large depth of field, where much of the image is in focus. Neither is intrinsically good or bad, it all depends on what you are trying to communicate with your image. Here are examples with shallow depth of field:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/08-aperture-01.jpg'/><br><br>and large depth of field:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/08-aperture-02.jpg'/><br><br>A large part of the confusion linked to aperture comes from the user very-unfriendly notation for aperture: the infamous f-stops. It is a dimensionless number obtained by black magic (actually not, but the real explanation is more confusing than helpful) but what it boils down to is: the smaller the number after the f, the larger the aperture: more light, less depth of field. This is why we care about the maximal aperture of a lens, which is the lowest f-number we can get. Of course, the higher the number, the smaller the aperture: less light, more depth of field.<br><br>It gets worse. Remember how in the last lesson, we defined a stop of exposure to be the doubling of the amount of light which reaches the sensor? It was easy with shutter speeds because we could just double the speed. However, to get one more stop with aperture, you shouldn't multiply by 2 but divide by 1.414 (square root of 2). Since no one actually calculates that, photographers remember instead the usual sequence of f-numbers: f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22 (and sometimes f/32, f/45, f/64). You don't have to learn these numbers by heart, but it is helpful to know which number comes before and after each other: to know that if you are shooting at f/4 and want one less stop of exposure, you should go to f/5.6, etc. Thankfully, if you start paying attention to your aperture, you will start remembering them very quickly, as they always stay the same.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/08-aperture-04.jpg'/><br><br>But wait, it's not quite over yet. There is another important factor you should take into account when you are choosing your aperture. If you shoot outdoors, you will often find yourself in a situation where you want depth of field to be as large as possible and you have more than enough light to use any aperture you want (this means that the corresponding ISO and shutter speed to obtain a good exposure will both be within acceptable boundaries). According to what we just talked about, your natural reaction would be to close aperture as much as possible, using something like f/22.<br><br>That would be a bad idea. The reason is called diffraction, an optical phenomenon which becomes noticeable as light is forced to go through an increasingly narrow aperture. What this means concretely is that your image will be less and less sharp as you close your aperture. This is usually noticeable only from f/11 or so, however. Most lenses also have to make optical compromises to obtain larger apertures, so won't be quite perfectly sharp when fully open (low f/stops).<br><br>The consequence is that each lens has a sweet spot, an optimal aperture at which its sharpness is optimal. The further you step away from this aperture, the worse the results will be. Depending on the general quality of the lens, it could be hardly noticeable, or it could ruin your images. The exact value of the sweet spot depends on each particular lens, but for DSLR equipment, it is usually around f/8, which makes this a good default aperture (hence the old saying \"f/8 and be there\").<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/08-aperture-03.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>Today's assignment will be pretty short. The idea is simply to play with aperture and see how it impacts depth of field and the effects of diffraction. Put your camera in aperture priority (if you have such a mode), then find a good subject: it should be clearly separated from its background and neither too close nor too far away from you, something like 2-5m away from you and at least 10m away from the background. Take pictures of it at all the apertures you can find, taking notice of how the shutter speed is compensating for these changes. Make sure you are always focusing on the subject and never on the background.<br><br>Back on your computer, see how depth of field changes with aperture. Also compare sharpness of an image at f/8 and one at f/22 (or whatever your smallest aperture was): zoomed in at 100%, the latter should be noticeably less sharp in the focused area."

		content: "In this lesson, we will tackle the last of the three exposure controls (along with shutter speed and aperture): the ISO speed, also sometimes called sensitivity. Once you have mastered these three controls, you will know 90% of what you need to know to create (technically) good images which reflect your vision.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/09-iso-1.jpg'/><br><br>If we go once again (last time, I promise) to the pipe and bucket analogy, ISO corresponds to how fine the filter above the bucket is. If you decide to use a very fine filter (low ISO), you will get high quality water (light), but less of it. This is ok as long as you have enough water to fill your bucket, as you can afford to be picky, but when the flow reduces (it gets dark), you will have to make compromises and increase the coarseness of your filter (increase the ISO), which means you will get impure water with increasing amounts of garbage (noise) mixed in.<br><br>ISO is one of the fundamental differences between film and digital (which we will discuss in more details later). It is a physical property of the film you are using, and the only way to modify it is to change to a new roll - not the most convenient. With digital, you can easily change ISO between shots, simply by turning a wheel (or for the unlucky, digging into a menu), which permits perfect adaptation to the current light conditions. For those who shot film a long time ago, you may have used different words for sensibility: ASA or din. The first is exactly the same than our current ISO, it simply changed name when it became standardized. The latter uses another logarithmic scale and is completely outdated. Conversion between the two is quite straightforward, though.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/09-iso-3.jpg'/><br><br>Concretely, increasing ISO means allowing more light in, but also more noise, especially in the shadows. Exactly how much noise depends on your sensor - typically, larger and more recent sensors can go to higher ISOs before noise becomes unacceptable, sometimes to ridiculous levels like with the Nikon D3s. It is quite deterministic, though: the same camera will always produce the same amount of noise at the same ISO, so it can be very useful to do some testing on your camera and see how bad it exactly is. Every photographer tends to have a list of ISO values: base ISO (see further), first ISO at which noise is noticeable, maximum acceptable ISO for good quality (that's the really important one), maximum ISO he is willing to use in an emergency.<br><br>Like shutter speed and unlike aperture, ISO is a linear value. Double it and you double the amount of light. This makes it easier to determine what a stop is: simply a doubling of the ISO value. So if you are shooting at ISO 800 and want one stop of underexposure, go to ISO 400. If you want one stop of overexposure, go to ISO 1600.<br><br>It is fairly easy to remove noise from an image, and most cameras have some form of noise reduction accessible through the menus. However, what this does exactly is often misunderstood: if removing noise is indeed easy, what definitely isn't is keeping the details accurate. Due to the way NR works (averaging pixels in each zone to suppress those that \"stand out\" too much), it will also smooth textures and overwrite fine details, leading to a very plastic look which appears instinctively wrong. It is especially disturbing with skin tones, as heavy NR will make it look like your subject went bananas with makeup.<br><br>What this boils down to is: even with good noise reduction, noise remains relatively unescapable, and if you aren't careful, the medicine will prove worse than the illness.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/09-iso-2.jpg'/><br><br>Every camera has a base ISO, usually between 100 and 200. This is the sensibility at which image quality will be optimal, and you should move away from it only when you have a good reason to. Going to higher ISOs will, of course, increase noise, but perhaps surprisingly, going below it will result in decreased dynamic range.<br><br>One other misconception is that you can avoid increasing ISO by instead underexposing the image and bringing exposure back up in post-processing. Ironically, this is exactly what your camera does when you increase ISO, so you will get exactly the same amount of noise.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/09-iso-4.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>As in the past two days, this assignment will be quite short and simply designed to make you more familiar with the ISO setting of your camera.<br><br>First look into your manual to see whether it is possible to display the ISO setting on the screen while you are shooting. If not, it is at least almost certainly possible to display it after you shot, on the review screen.<br><br>Find a well lit subject and shoot it at every ISO your camera offers, starting at the base ISO and ending up at 12,800 or whatever the highest ISO that your camera offers. Repeat the assignment with a 2 stops underexposure. Try repeating it with different settings of in-camera noise reduction (off, moderate and high are often offered).<br><br>Now look at your images on the computer. Make notes of at the ISO at which you start noticing the noise, and at which ISO you find it unacceptably high. Also compare a clean, low ISO image with no noise reduction to a high ISO with heavy NR, and look for how well details and textures are conserved."

The last piece of the puzzle is understanding how the camera decides what constitutes a good exposure - how it meters the scene.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/10-1.jpg'/><br><br>In its most basic form, the meter of your camera will measure light coming from the subject through the lens, then use that information to set exposure parameters which would result in an average exposure of 18% grey - that is, the exposure is the same than if you had photographed an even bright gray light source. You are then free to modify either the total exposure (via exposure compensation or manual mode) or the individual parameters.<br><br>On most modern cameras, three different meter modes of greater complexity than the 18% grey can be found. In order of usefulness, they are:<br><br>Multi-zone metering, also called matrix, evaluative or segment. It could be nicknamed \"smart metering\" and is most probably the default metering mode on your camera. It works by measuring light levels over many small segments covering the whole frame. It then uses algorithms to decide what the exposure should look like, using all sorts of parameters (subject distance, focus area, even time of day...) and matching the scene with a database of thousands of pre-recorded images, trying to really understand what you are photographing and where your subject is in the frame. Each camera has its own algorithms which are kept secret, so from a user point of view, it may appear to be a bit \"magic\". It also pays off to study how your camera reacts to each type of scene and in which situations it may guess wrong.<br><br>For instance, snow scenes are notably tricky to expose, as the camera may panic, thinking all this whiteness is awful overexposure which must be brought down to a more reasonable bright grey. Some modern cameras are now smart enough to recognize that it is indeed snow and should be left very bright, while others still need a manual one or two stops of overexposure. The only way of knowing how smart your particular camera is is to try it in a variety of situations.<br><br>Spot metering is more or less the opposite: it measures light only in a tiny part of the frame (1 to 5% usually), often following the active autofocus sensor, or simply in the centre of the frame. This is very useful in extreme light conditions, as it allows you to expose for your subject without caring for the rest of the frame. The typical example is a night shot of the moon: if you use any other mode than spot, the camera will try to overexpose the very dark sky which fills the vast majority of the frame, and completely blow the highlights in the bright moon.<br><br>Finally, centre weighted metering is a form of multi-zone metering which privileges the centre of the frame to the sides. It was mostly used in the film days, when multi-zone meters were still archaic or non-existent, but there is little reason to use it anymore.<br><br>So in a nutshell, it is usually safe to stay in multi-zone metering for most of your shooting, with two caveats: the camera can make mistakes in complicated scenes and shouldn't be trusted completely, and spot metering is useful in high contrast scenes, especially when the subject you want to expose for is small in the frame.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/10-2.jpg'/><br><br>There is a button found on most cameras which tends to remain fairly obscure (some would say scary): AE-L/AF-L. What it does is lock either exposure, focus or both (it can be decided in the menus). If you set it to exposure lock, it will be useful when you shoot in spot mode: put your subject in the centre, press the shutter halfway to meter, then press AE-L to lock the exposure parameters, then recompose to put your subject where you really want it - as we will see later in this course, it is very boring to position a subject dead in the centre of the frame. AE-L tends to be less useful with multi-zone metering.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/10-3.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>In today's assignment, you will have a bit more freedom than usual, as it will depend heavily on the subjects you find. Try to find a subject difficult to expose, either because it has a lot of contrast or because it has large parts intentionally darker or brighter than 18% grey. Try to catch your multi-zone meter making a mistake, and see if you can reproduce this with another similar subject.<br><br>Find a small, bright subject in a dark environment - it could simply be a room with lights shut and a headlamp shining on a piece of paper, and try to expose properly with multi-zone meter. Now do the same in spot mode. For bonus points, position the subject well off-centre."

		content: "Welcome to part 3 of the course. We are now done with some of the most important concepts in photography, covered in part 2 - exposure, and can discuss another important idea: focus.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/11-01.jpg'/><br><br>Not everything in a picture is sharp, usually. For optical reasons, objects at a specific distance will appear sharp while others at different distances will be blurred. Moreover, there is a plane of focus, always parallel to the sensor (so orthogonal to the lens), and everything on that plane will appear perfectly sharp. The further away from it, the blurrier things will appear. Focusing the lens then corresponds to the action of moving this plane backward or forward until it is positioned on your subject. As we will see in a further lesson, this is actually not completely true, as there are two planes, with everything in between sharp, the distance between them being called depth of field, but for now, we can use the idea of a single plane as a convenient approximation.<br><br>There are two ways to adjust focus: either let the camera try to detect the distance from your subject and set focus accordingly (autofocus, this lesson), or do it manually (manual focus, our next lesson). If, like the vast majority of photographers since the 90s, you are using autofocus, your camera probably offers a variety of different ways to control how exactly the system works. Though this can differ from model to model, the basics are usually the same for every camera.<br><br>The most fundamental option you have is whether to use a manual single point of focus, or let the camera decide which one of its many AF-sensors to use. The AF system only works with a single point of the image. You can choose to direct the camera's attention and tell it \"here, whatever is below that point in the viewfinder is my subject, please focus on it\" or let it go in auto mode, using all its resources to make the smartest guess. It can be something moving which you probably want sharp, or something in the centre of the frame which takes a lot of space and is much closer than the background, or a variety of other possibilities. In recent years, the development of face detection has improved these systems, since you will rarely want to have someone's face appear blurred when the rest of the frame is sharp. As always, there is no right or wrong choice: it is entirely up to how smart your camera is, how much you want to trust it to make the right choice and how complicated your subject is.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/11-03.jpg'/><br><br>Low light tends to be particularly problematic for focus, be it automatic or manual. Without any light to start with, it is impossible for either you or the camera to decide how far your subject is. It should be noted here that autofocus is always performed with aperture fully open, so fast lenses (with large maximal aperture) will focus much better in low light than cheaper, slower ones. One workaround is the ubiquitous AF-assist lamp, which turns on for a few brief moments before the image is taken, for the unique benefit of the autofocus system. As long as your subject is not more than a few meters away, it is very efficient, but can not perform miracles for scenes more challenging.<br><br>Finally, mention should be made of the AF-L button already mentioned in the previous lesson. It can be set to remember focus as well as exposure, in which case it is very useful to perform \"focus and recompose\" while in focus priority mode: put the subject dead centre (or below your active AF sensor), press the shutter halfway to focus, press the AF-L button, then recompose your image and finally press the shutter to take the photo.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/11-02.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>Find a scene with multiple objects at different distances, say 1m away, 10m away and a long distance away. A good example might be looking down a road with a tree in the foreground acting as your 1m target, a (parked) car a bit further down your 10m target, and some far away car or building in the distance as your long target. You may want to do all this in aperture priority mode with a wide aperture (remember, that means a low f-spot number), since as we'll learn more about on Thursday, this decreases the depth of field and so makes the difference in focus between your objects more accentuated. If you can't eye the differences in focus, although it should be reasonably obvious, take some photos, then look at the differences up-close on a computer.<br><br>Set the the focus to autofocus single (AF-S on at least Nikon and Olympus cameras) and experiment with the different autofocus points. Looking through the viewfinder (or at the live preview if your camera doesn't have a viewfinder), use the half press to bring different subjects in different areas of your screen into focus. Try using the automatic autofocus point mode and try to get a feel for how your camera chooses which point to focus on. At the least make sure you know which point it is focussing on: this is typically indicated by the point flashing red.<br><br>Also play around with the difference between single and continuous autofocus, if your camera supports it. In AF-C mode, focus on something and move the framing until an object at a different distance falls under the autofocus sensor and observe your camera refocussing. Also see if you can configure your camera to prevent this refocussing when you press the AEL/AFL button."

However, there are many situations where you might want to take over that important task and do it yourself.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/12-02.jpg'/><br><br>The only practical way of focusing manually is via a ring on the lens. Sadly, manufacturers still haven't agreed on which of the zoom or focus ring should be closer to the photographer, so there is no general rule, but those two rings should be found on any modern zoom lens. Most lenses and cameras require you to flip a physical switch to alternate between AF and MF. Some modern lenses also offer a very useful M/A mode: autofocus is used normally, but you can turn the manual focus ring at any point to override the camera and take control.<br><br>To achieve correct focus, you need a way of evaluating accurately how sharp your subject is. This means that you need to have a viewfinder large enough that small differences in focus will show. Sadly, most entry level DSLRs have tiny viewfinders, and this is one place where higher end bodies will make a clear difference. If you frame with liveview or an electronic viewfinder, you can often ask the camera to magnify the central area, thus allowing very precise focusing, the downside being the slowness of the whole process.<br><br>Even when you are in MF mode, the AF sensor will remain active and give you focus information. Just like the light meter tells you when it thinks you have achieved a good exposure in manual mode but lets you decide what to do with that information, the AF sensor will tell you when it thinks you have a well focused image, usually via means of a dot appearing in the viewfinder. Of course, you probably shouldn't trust it entirely (if you do, save yourself the trouble and go back to autofocus), but it is still useful information to have.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/12-03.jpg'/><br><br>It can make sense to use manual focus in the following situations:<br><br>If your autofocus system is not up to par or if your subject is too complicated. This can happen for instance in cases where you have multiple objects at varying distances which could each equally well be your subject. The camera will try to guess which one you want to focus on, but it can't read your mind. Focus and recompose in single AF mode can be useful here, but it is sometimes simpler to just switch to MF and take full control.<br><br>More generally, as soon as you won't want to focus on the obvious subject, switch to MF. For instance, you might be shooting a car race but want to focus on a detail of the road in front of the moving car. Chances are that your AF system will see this big thing moving fast into the frame and assume this is what you are interested in, losing the focus from the road.<br><br>In street photography or other situations where your subject might be moving very fast and you only have a split second to get the shot, you can use MF to prefocus on the place where you expect the subject to appear. This is a favourite technique of Leica shooters in particular. To use it, you simply need to find an object at roughly the same distance than your expected subject, focus on it (wiuth either MF or AF), then go into MF mode and wait for the decisive moment.<br><br>As we discussed yesterday, AF systems can't work very well if there is not enough light. You probably won't be able to manually focus precisely either, but you can use the distance scale found on all but the cheapest lenses, making an educated guess as to the distance to your subject. When the AF system \"hunts\" without any result (tries the whole range back and forth, then gives up), you should either switch to manual focus or abandon the image altogether.<br><br>Finally, the last case is for careful tripod shots. With a good viewfinder or a magnified liveview, manual focus is much more precise than any autofocus system, so for those who want the absolute best out of their images, MF is a good option.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/12-01.jpg'/>"

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "In this third and last lesson of the \"Focus\" part of the course, we will revisit the topic of depth of field (henceforth abbreviated DoF), which we already talked about briefly in the aperture lesson. Back then, we were mostly concerned about how DoF is affected by changing the aperture, but we should now discuss how DoF itself can be used as an important creative tool.<br><br>If you remember, we defined depth of field as the distance between the closest object in focus and the largest in focus. As we saw in a previous lesson, everything on a plane parallel to the sensor will be in perfect focus. But there are actually two planes, parallel to each other, and everything between them is in focus. The distance between them is our depth of field.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/13-01.jpg'/><br><br>For instance, on this image, the first plane is parallel to me and intersects the shelf between the 'J' and the 'E' of 'SUBJECT'. The second plane intersects somewhere after the 'S' of 'BIOGRAPHIES'. Since the books are receded, the first one on the right is just behind the far plane, so almost in focus but not quite entirely. Here, DoF is about 5cm.<br><br>All we talked about in the previous two lessons is about positioning the plane of perfect focus. Depth of field is about how much we include around it.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/13-02.jpg'/><br><br>Shallow depth of field is an extremely useful technique: by having a really small DoF, we can direct the attention of the viewer to exactly where we want it, on the subject. Background and foreground will be thrown out of focus, still present but much less distracting. This is a technique for subject separation. It also gives images what I can only call a \"slick\" look. Since it is somewhat difficult to achieve (if you don't know what you are doing), we tend to automatically consider shallow DoF images as professional, or at least of a higher standard. In the motion world, it is also part of what is called the \"film look\", and is one of the reasons the introduction of video capable DSLRs was such a big deal.<br><br>We already saw that one ingredient for shallow DoF was opening your aperture as much as possible (using a small f number), which is a partial explanation of why some photographers spend so much money on fast lenses. There are however two others factors which are more often ignored: focal length and distance.<br><br>The actual focal length of the lens (not its 35mm equivalent) is the single most important parameter for achieving shallow DoF. The longer your focal, the shallower your DoF. This is why big sensors make subject separation easier to achieve, while it is nearly impossible with compact cameras (a bigger sensor means you need a longer focal length to achieve the same angle of view, remember the focal length lesson). So for portraits, privilege longer lenses.<br><br>The last factor is the ratio of the distance to the subject vs distance to the background. If you want a clear separation, get very close to your subject - which is why macro images like the following one have very shallow DoF. Conversely, if your subject is 100m away and the background only 150m away, you won't be able to achieve much separation, no matter how big your sensor and your lens.<br><br>Just remember: aperture is important, but it's far from the only factor.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/13-03.jpg'/><br><br>Shallow DoF is a useful tool, but not one you should be using on every single image (if only because it would lose much of its impact). Most of the time, you will probably want as much of the image as possible in focus. This is especially important with wide angle shots, for instance landscapes. Another instance where you want deep depth of field is when focus is hard to achieve, usually in low light, as it will allow you to make mistakes in the exact position of the focus plane and still get your subject relatively sharp. To achieve large DoF, the simplest is to close your aperture (using a large f number), though you probably want to be careful about diffraction.<br><br>There is however a nice trick you can use to increase DoF: hyperfocus. The idea is that when you focus on infinity (which happens frequently), you are \"losing\" some DoF: everything further than infinity is also in focus. What you can do instead is focusing closer to you so that the far away plane delimiting DoF is just barely at infinity (and not beyond). The distance at which this happens is called hyperfocal, and you can easily find calculators online - you only need to input your focal length and aperture, and it will tell you what the closest distance you can focus to is if you want to include infinity in your DoF. Because it is a bit calculation intensive and hard to evaluate on the spot, use of hyperfocal distance should probably be reserved to tripods and seasoned street photographers."

		content: "We have also reached a new milestone in this course - the discussion about the fundamentals of focus and exposure is complete and we can now turn to more practical considerations. In this fourth part, we will talk about the decision process involved with operating the camera, what your different options are and how choosing one over the other will impact the final image.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/14-01.jpg'/><br><br>The first topic we will discuss is this strange beast which is often the surest way to ruin a photo: the flash. It consists in generating your own light for the fraction of a second during which the camera shutter is open. As all photographers know, good light is a crucial ingredient of most great images, and the ability to create and mold your own light according to your exact needs is indeed a very powerful one. This is why many professionals worry much more about their lights than about cameras or lenses.<br><br>Without going into pro territory and their big lighting units, there are two types of artificial lights readily available to photographers: almost all cameras have a version or another of a pop-up flash, and if you have a hot shoe , you can attach an external flash (sometimes called strobe or flash gun). Pop-ups suffer from severe limitations: they can not be moved off camera or even oriented somewhere else than straight into the subject, they often lack power and they rarely allow much manual control. Finally, they draw their power directly from the main camera battery and will deplete it very fast. On the other hand, they are always available when you need it and do not require a bulky and expensive new device.<br><br>The best thing you can do with your flash is to take it off your camera. As you probably know already, frontal flash, used from roughly the same position than your lens, will flatten everything and create an ugly light. Used from a different position and at a different angle, your flash can do the opposite, increasing depth, shaping your subject or telling any story you want. To communicate with the remote flash unit, your camera can use either radio waves or, on some Nikon DSLRs, pre-flashes from the pop-up (so-called commander mode). Cheap radio transmitters can be found cheaply on ebay, though their reliability will tend to be less efficient than professional equipment such as pocket wizards. Another alternative is to use a wired connection, though you will obviously lose some range.<br><br>Most modern flash units are very smart and use a system of pre-flash to determine their optimal setting. This is what Nikon calls i-TTL and Canon E-TTL. Things go like this: before taking the picture, the camera orders the flash to fire at a predetermined level and records the exposure obtained. Based on this, the camera determines how strong the flash should be, sends it these new instructions and finally opens the shutter, orders the flash to fire and records the photo. All of this happens so fast that your eye doesn't notice any of it and simply sees a single flash trigger. Of course, you can also use manual modes, where you instruct each flash of whether it should fire at full power (1) or at a fraction of it (1/2, 1/4, 1/8... to 1/64 or below).<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/14-02.jpg'/><br><br>Without getting into any advanced lighting discussion, there are two main cases where you will want to use your flash: fill and low luminosity.<br><br>Fill flash is a great way to combat backlight and save high contrast scenes. It will typically be used to balance the exposure of a portrait with a bright background. With natural light, you could either expose for the subject and have a pure white background, or expose for the background and get a silhouette instead of a portrait. The key is to add just enough light to fill the subject while retaining a correctly exposed background. Used correctly, the technique will be invisible, making your scene look perfectly natural.<br><br>The basic recipe for fill is simple enough: expose for the background, then add a severely underexposed, greatly diffused flash on your main subject. Keep increasing the power of your flash until you get the right balance between subject and background - usually somewhere between -2 and -1 stop.<br><br>Flash can also be used to replace ambient light when the scene is really too dark - the default behaviour of many compacts when faced with the traditional indoor party picture. In this situation, you will want to do anything in your power to avoid full frontal bare flash. If you can, the easiest is to put your flash off camera and to one side, which will immediately create depth and add interest. If you are limited to on-camera flash, you have two solutions: diffuse or bounce.<br><br>In the first case, you make the light go through a translucent surface, which will scatter the rays and will create a softer, nicer light. You can use virtually anything that is see-through, my favourite being a paper napkin folded several times on itself.<br><br>The other possibility is bounce: you redirect the light to a white surface - a wall or the ceiling, which will then bounce back to your subject from another angle and with considerable diffusion. This only really works if the surface you bounce from is fairly close, as considerable power will be lost. If you are bouncing from something which isn't white, you will introduce a colour cast which will make a nightmare of your white balance. Bouncing can be as simple as orienting your flash toward the ceiling or using a business card tilted 45 degrees in front of your pop-up.<br><br>We have barely scratched the surface of what you can do with your flash. Thankfully, there is an amazing online resource if you want to learn more on the subject: David Hobby's Strobist. Consider in particular reading through his Lighting 101 course (though be aware that it is considerably more advanced than the present one).<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/14-04.jpg'/><br><br>Assignment<br><br>In this assignment, we will keep things simple and leave the flash on the camera. You can use either a stand-along flash unit or your pop-up flash.<br><br>Find a bright background - probably just an outdoor scene, and place a willing victim in front of it. Take an image with natural light, exposing for the background and verify that your subject is indeed too dark. Now use fill flash to try and expose him properly. If you can manually modify the power of your flash, do so until you have a natural looking scene. If you can't do it through the menus, use translucent material to limit the quantity of light reaching your subject (which has the added benefit of softening the light). A piece of white paper or a napkin works well, though you can of course be more creative if you want.<br><br>In the second part, go indoor into a place dark enough that you can't get sharp images unless you go to unacceptable noise levels. Try to take a portrait with normal, undiffused, unbounced frontal flash. Now try diffusing your flash to different levels and observe how the light changes. Do the same thing with bounces from the sidewalls, then from the ceiling. Observe how the shadows are moving in different directions and you get different moods.<br><br>Finally, make a blood oath never again to use frontal bare flash on anybody."

		content: "For the most part, all you really need to take photographs is a camera and a lens, and little more. However, of all the accessories some companies are trying to convince you will make you a better photographer, one has a special place: the tripod (and its siblings the monopod and the tabletop tripod).<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/15-01.jpg'/><br><br>A tripod is a simple object: three legs and a way to connect to the camera (usually via a ballhead) will provide a stable platform. As you probably remember from the shutter speed lesson, below a certain threshold (which depends on many factors: focal length, sensor size, your age and physical condition, optical stabilisation...), it is impossible to obtain sharp images: you simply aren't stable enough. A tripod allows you to shoot from more or less any position you normally would, and to use any shutter speed you want, up to several hours if your battery can last that long.<br><br>There are two main situations where this can prove useful. The first, quite obviously, is very low light (indoor, dusk or night). If your ISO is up to the maximum acceptable level and your aperture is fully open but your shutter speed still not above the handheld threshold for a correct exposure, then you will have to use a tripod - or at least a stable platform. Monopods can help you gain 1-3 stops of exposure, but they will prove inadequate when light is really too low.<br><br>The other type of situation is when you could shoot a sharp image but would have to make compromises on image quality: either open the aperture so much that you don't have as much depth of field as you would want, or put ISO so high that noise is noticeable. A tripod allows you to get the best possible image quality by making shutter speed irrelevant in the exposure.<br><br>A third important property of tripods is that they are slow to use. They need time to set up, extend the legs, position precisely, and framing usually involves turning several knobs. This is both a good and a bad thing: on one hand, it may make you miss the image you were after, or might make you convince yourself that an image is not worth the trouble. On the other hand, it forces you to slow down and think about the image you are creating: is it the best one I can get from this spot? Is it really saying what I want to communicate? Can I do something to make it better? It is crucial to ask yourself all these questions each time you press the shutter, hence why a tripod can be a good learning tool.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/15-02.jpg'/><br><br>The ability to use very long exposures also opens some new possibilities. We already discussed some of them in the shutter speed lesson. Some others include light painting (writing something with a light source much brighter than the rest of the scene), ghosts (making someone appear dreamy or otherworldly when they move through a long exposure, see the previous image) and star trails (see the following image). As always, remember you should use special effects to help convey your story, not for their own sake.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/15-03.jpg'/><br><br>Many photographers think that it is enough to stick their camera on top of the tripod to get perfectly sharp images. While it will certainly produce better results than handheld, there is also a proper technique to be used to get the most out of your tripod. Failure to observe any of these rules will negate the advantages of actually using a tripod.<br><br>It needs to be heavy enough that neither wind nor the camera can generate vibrations. Many models have a hook below the central column/ballhead on which a heavy pack can be attached. Just make sure it actually touches the ground, or its swinging would make things even worse.<br><br>The ballhead needs to be well adapted to the weight of your camera and lens. It needs to be well below the maximal load or slippage will occur.<br><br>Never use the central column if you can avoid it. It weakens the whole structure and greatly amplifies vibrations.<br><br>When you take a photo with a DSLR, the mirror slaps up and down very fast, which generates some vibrations. Advanced models offer a mode called Mirror Lock Up (MLU) in which the mirror stays up. This means you can't use the optical viewfinder and will either have to preframe or to use liveview.<br><br>When you physically press the shutter, you will also push the whole body which can also create vibrations. You should either use a remote trigger (wired or not) or the self-timer set on a value of at least 5 seconds, so that vibrations have enough time to die."

		content: "Filters are another accessory often carried on location, but their usefulness can vary greatly. In short, they are a piece of glass with various optical properties which can be put in front of the lens to modify the image in certain ways. It should be noted that all filters will somewhat degrade image quality by adding another barrier to the light entering the lens. They will also increase flare problems (coloured rings formed when a bright light source - usually the sun - is close to or inside the frame). For these reasons, filters should be reserved to situations where they will make a real difference, and investment in good quality filters will pay off in better image quality.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/16-01.jpg'/><br><br>Let's review some of the common types of filters.<br><br>Clear filters are the simplest of them all: they are simply transparent glass. They are used to physically protect the front element of the lens but, unless you are very careless with your gear, should probably be reserved for situations where your lens has a good chance to get damaged: extreme sports, muddy terrain, etc.<br><br>UV filters are most often used as clear filters, simply for physical protection. Since they only block UV waves which are invisible to the eye, they appear to be transparent. Their UV blocking properties supposedly come into play for high altitude photography, where they should remove some of the annoying blue tint in shadows, but digital sensors as well as modern film has very little sensitivity to UV anymore. In my experience, they make absolutely no visible improvement to the image.<br><br>Polarizers are loved by many, especially in their circular form. When light bounces off a surface, its physical properties are slightly modified. A polarizer can filter light with such properties, which permits eliminating reflections, something which can be very useful if, for instance, you are shooting through a window or if your subject has a glossy screen. An interesting side-effect is that this filter will also darken the sky and somewhat increase contrast, which is often the real reason people use them. This, in my opinion, is less useful since it can easily be reproduced in post-processing.<br><br>You should consider using a polarizer if your scene has reflections you want to eliminate or if you want just a little bit of extra \"pop\" in your sky. Be aware that you will lose some light and that unless you use very high quality filters, image quality will also likely suffer.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/16-02.jpg'/><br><br>ND filters (Neutral Density) are almost as simple as clear filters: they are simply darkening the image, reducing evenly the amount of light reaching the sensor. They are useful in a single situation: when you want very long exposure in daylight, usually for effects (see the previous lesson) but sometimes simply to allow a shallower depth of field in very bright situations.<br><br>Grad ND are similar to ND except that they have a gradient, usually linear: they are darker at the top than at the bottom. They are used for scenes which have too much contrast: usually, the sky is so bright and the foreground so dark that you can't get an exposure with a histogram which doesn't clip. A grad ND carefully used will allow you to darken the sky without modifying the foreground.<br><br>They have two main problems, though: they require a bulky and annoying external holder, as a screw-in would not allow positioning the gradient with enough freedom. The other problem is that relatively few scenes have a linear transition between areas you want to brighten and darken, which leads to imperfect, and in some cases artificial looking, results.<br><br>The main alternative is to use HDR, though you will have to work much harder in post-processing, doubly so if you want your images to appear realistic.<br><br>Finally, coloured filters modify white balance (see our next lesson). They were useful in the film days, where it was very difficult, if not impossible, to change white balance. With digital, however, it has become very easy and even, if you shoot raw, possible to do in post-processing without any quality loss. Warming and cooling filters are thus completely useless, except if you still shoot film.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/16-03.jpg'/><br><br>Going further: There's an excellent page on the subject by Thom Hogan."

		content: "Have you ever taken a photo where the colours appear all wrong? For instance with a strong blue or orange tint (what is called a colour cast)? If you ever took a picture at night, it most probably happened to you a fair few times. This is a case of wrong white balance: the colours are not well balanced with each other, and casts appear. One particularly visible consequence is that white is not pure white anymore, but slightly yellow or blue instead.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/17-01.jpg'/><br><br>This is because not all light is created equal, and some have warmer components than others (i.e. they have stronger yellow and reds than blue and greens). We speak of light temperature, of which there is an actual scientific definition, though it's not worth getting into this now. For instance, tungsten light (the usual incandescent lamps) appears much warmer than daylight sun, which is why it appears so yellow on night photographs. Fluorescent lights, on the other hand, are quite cold, explaining the \"sterile\" and inhuman look some offices have.<br><br>Unless it is extremely basic, your camera probably has a White Balance setting (often abbreviated in WB). Its usual modes are Auto (abbreviated AWB), Sunny, Shade, Fluorescent and Tungsten (with standard icons, see below). Choosing one other than Auto will tell the camera how to compensate for the current light conditions so that a white object really appears white.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/17-02.jpg'/><br><br>Film photographers have it much harder, as the only two ways of controlling white balance are to use a different film (some are known to be warmer than others) or to use coloured filters.<br><br>Despite its somewhat technical nature, white balance is a very important creative tool, as we tend to have instinctual reactions to the set of colours used in an image: warm tones convey an idea of comfort, softness, happiness, while cold colours are usually distant, hostile and cruel. If it fits your vision, you should not hesitate to introduce (subtle) colour casts to enhance the message you are trying to convey.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/17-03.jpg'/><br><br>Choosing the right white balance may seem like a difficult task. After all, our brain is so good at compensating colour casts that we rarely notice if our current environment is more of a tungsten or a fluorescent light. There are however very good news for digital photographers: if you shoot raw instead of jpg (which we will discuss in more detail in a later lesson), you will be able to set white balance after the shoot, in post-processing, with no loss of image quality. In other words, you do not need to worry about white balance at all until you get back to your computer, at which point, as we will see in a moment, it is a much easier task.<br><br>If you want to get white balance right in camera (because you are shooting jpg, or because you want to spend as little time on the computer as possible), you have three possibilities:<br><br>You can trust the camera with the job and shoot in AWB. Most modern cameras will do a pretty good job as long as the conditions are reasonable, but all bets are off when you add mixed, complicated lighting. In short, you can probably forget about WB as long as you are shooting natural light by day, but you should be paying attention once you add any kind of artificial light.<br><br>You can try to guess what the light composition is and set the camera WB in the relevant mode. It helps to also know that \"fluorescent\" means the image will get warmer, while \"tungsten\" means it will get cooler - using the screen, you can use trial and error until you get a WB that corresponds to your vision. This is quite cumbersome and you will occasionally forget to reset your WB mode between shoots, but with enough practice, it can work well.<br><br>Finally, you can use a grey card to create your own WB mode. This is definitely the most accurate method, but it is also the most complex and time consuming. What you are doing is take a photo of a neutral gray piece of paper (anything will do, really, but many stores will be happy to sell you overpriced pieces of cardboard), then tell the camera that this should be its new reference point for WB from now on. Obviously, you will need to repeat this process every time the lighting changes.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/17-04.jpg'/><br><br>If, on the other hand, you shoot raw, you can adjust WB in post. There are several ways to do this, one of which being to use the same modes than your camera or to use sliders to set light temperature to the exact values you want. However, the easiest method of all is simply to pick out a neutral part of the image and tell the software \"this should be neutral, please adjust white balance accordingly\". As long as you can find an object that should be some shade of grey, you obtain results just as accurate as if you had used the custom WB procedure. Of course, it will occasionally happen that you can't find anything neutral, and you might have to resort to the sliders and your own memory of the scene. To prevent this kind of scenarios, some photographers do take a picture of a grey card at the beginning of an important shoot, in order to have a point of reference.<br><br>Assignment<br><br>This assignment is here for your to play with your white balance settings. It helps if your camera has the ability to shoot raw: for each part of the assignment, take each photo in both jpg and raw (you can use the raw+jpg mode found on most cameras) and try the post processing on both, comparing the results at the end. You will also need a grey card, anything white or grey which isn't too translucent will do just fine.<br><br>For the first part, go outside by day. It doesn't matter if the weather is cloudy or sunny, as long as it's natural light. First, set your WB mode to Auto and take a photo. Now do the same in every WB mode your camera has. Don't forget to take a shot of the grey card.<br><br>Repeat the exercise indoor, in an artificially lit scene. First, try it with only one type of light (probably tungsten), then, if you can, with both tungsten and fluorescent in the same scene.<br><br>Once you have all the images, download them on your computer and open them in a software which can handle basic raw conversion. Observe how different all the images look, and try to get a correct WB of each one just by eye and by using the temperature sliders. Now use the grey card shots to find out the real temperature and use this to automatically correct all the images of each shoot (there usually is a \"batch\" or a copy-and-paste feature for this). Finally, notice how raw files should all end up looking exactly the same, while the jpg files will be somewhat degraded in quality."

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "Except for the most advanced models, all digital cameras sport a variety of scene modes, which are there to help set the parameters of the camera in a way that fits the subject you are trying to photograph. Some that can be commonly found are portrait, landscape, macro, snow, night and sport, but recent cameras take this to absurd levels, with more and more advanced modes appearing. The alternative is to use one of the four \"traditional\" exposure modes: Program, Aperture Priority (Av on Canon), Speed priority (Tv on Canon) and Manual.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/18-01.jpg'/><br><br>Scene modes have a place, as an adequate way of using a camera for people who do not have a good grasp of the different parameters involved in the use of a camera. However, if you have read the lessons on exposure and on focus, you should be well equipped to graduate to PASM modes. There are two major issues with scene modes:<br><br>They are \"black boxes\". There is no documentation anywhere saying \"sport mode will try to keep a high shutter speed\" or \"night mode will increase ISO\". You can make guesses, but there is no way of knowing what really is going on. You are effectively relinquishing all control to the camera and will have little or no possibility to express what your vision for the image is.<br><br>The exact effects of scene modes vary between manufacturers, sometimes even between camera models. It is far too easy to be surprised by some of the choices, for instance by when the camera will decide to increase ISO and to what levels. The only thing you know about how the camera works when you select the portrait mode is that \"an engineer in Japan thinks these parameters will work in most cases for taking portraits\".<br><br>The other reason is that scene modes are mutually exclusive. You can't be in several at the same time. But what if you want to take a portrait at night? Or to photograph a kid in a snowy landscape? Knowing which one to choose can be an impossible task unless you know exactly what each mode does, which brings us back to the previous point.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/18-02.jpg'/><br><br>Unlike scene modes which potentially modify every single parameter in the camera, PASM modes only concern themselves with two exposure controls: aperture and shutter speed. Let's review each of the four modes:<br><br>Program is a sort of \"Auto\" of exposure modes. The camera picks the aperture and speed it thinks are best suited to the scene, depending on a variety of parameters (for instance, it will usually try to use a safe handheld speed). You still have control, as you can change the picked couple with a turn of the control wheel. If you close the aperture, speed will lengthen, and vice versa. Whether the camera changes aperture or shutter speed when you use the exposure compensation button is up to internal algorithms.<br><br>Program is a pretty good mode that should be preferred to scene modes if you are still afraid to go into the more manual modes. You don't have complete control, but at least you know exactly what is going on. It is also a good mode to use when you know you'll only have a split second to take a shot and want to have sane parameters without having to touch anything.<br><br>Aperture priority is the default mode of most serious photographers (i.e. they use the other ones only when they have a good reason to). You control the aperture, and the camera takes care of the shutter speed. When you use exposure compensation, the camera will only modify shutter speed, leaving aperture to whatever you have chosen.<br><br>This is a good mode for most pictures because you usually don't care so much about what the shutter speed is, as long as it is fast enough to produce sharp images. On the other hand, aperture controls depth of field, which you want to pay attention to in every single image. A good way to take pictures is to set aperture to a default f/8, often the sweet spots of most lenses and giving a generous depth of field, changing only when either the light gets too low for handheld photography (always keep an eye on that shutter speed) or because you explicitly want more or less depth of field.<br><br>Speed priority is a bit more specialized. It is the exact opposite of Aperture priority: you choose the speed and the camera deals with the aperture. It is useful mostly when you need a specific speed to get the effect you are after. Sport and wildlife photographers in particular use S mode often, as they will need very high speeds (often 1/1000 or more) to properly freeze the action. The big downside of using S mode is that depth of field will potentially be all over the place.<br><br>Manual mode is possibly the least useful mode of all (though many consider it the purest). You get to fix both aperture and shutter speed yourself, with no help from the camera other than a mention of how off it thinks you are (usually via a set of bars in the viewfinder). This is useful mostly when you don't trust the light meter for some reason. It is often possible to use exposure lock (the AE-L button) instead of going to manual.<br><br>You often find people advising beginners to shoot in full manual mode in order to gain a better understanding of their camera. While there is some wisdom in the advice, it is also a great way to burn out quickly, and there won't be much advantage over shooting in aperture or speed priority.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/18-03.jpg'/><br><br>So far, we have only talked about aperture and shutter speed, but not mentioned the third exposure parameter: ISO. All these modes are legacies from film cameras, where it wasn't possible to control ISO anyway (it was a physical property of the film). Most modern cameras have some form of AutoISO mode, usually enabled in the menus, with various parameters. This, unfortunately, is somewhat of a return to scene modes, as it is difficult to understand what exactly is going on and to gain the control you want (though, to their credit, some manufacturers do explain how their algorithm works).<br><br>Since ISO is usually the last parameter you want to change, I would argue that it is best to leave it as a manual control and not rely on AutoISO, but this is more of a personal thing and many photographers have incorporated conservative uses of AutoISO in their workflows.<br><br>Assignment<br><br>This assignment is very simple but should also be good fun: take a walk in your city or somewhere you find interesting and shoot pictures. They certainly don't have to all be beautiful or mind-blowing, but try to make an effort to find real subjects instead of pointing the camera in random directions. Just tell your internal editor to shut up.<br><br>There is only one rule: you need to take at least 20 different pictures in each of five different configurations: using scene modes, using program, using aperture priority, using speed priority and using manual mode. So you should have a minimum of 100 pictures by the end of this. It may sound like a lot, but you will probably be surprised how fast you can attain that goal once you get going.<br><br>Once back home, post your favourite three in here and explain which mode it was taken with. For bonus points, give us your impressions of using each mode and why you prefer one to the other."

		content: "One of the defining differences between low and high end digital cameras is the ability to shoot raw files instead of the usual jpg. To really understand what the difference between the two types of file is, we need to go back to the components of a camera. As you may remember from that lesson, a digital sensor is only a grid of photo sensitive receptors, and the result of an exposure is just a big bunch of numbers corresponding to the light level recorded at each pixel. This does not make a visible image yet, as a number of steps are still required before it can be viewed. In particular, obtaining colour information for each pixel needs a process called demosaicing, but you also need to apply white balance, a contrast curve, sharpening, saturation and possibly some other treatments, for instance noise reduction.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/19-01.jpg'/><br><br>There are two ways to perform this. You can either let your camera do it for you, with minimal input, resulting in a file ready to be viewed, usually in the standard jpg format. Alternatively, you can tell the camera to do as little as possible and perform each step yourself at a later point, with dedicated software.<br><br>JPG has the obvious advantage of simplicity. There is no need to spend additional time in front of a computer. In this sense, it can be viewed as an extension of the auto mode, which definitely has its uses.<br><br>Another point is that the manufacturers designing the image processing pipeline know the camera internals best, which (at least in theory) enables them to get the most out of the sensor.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/19-02.jpg'/><br><br>Raw, on the other hand, is a complex beast and will require additional effort from the photographer. There are, however, significant benefits: since you have manual control, you can get the absolute best of your file, and have much more latitude to adjust the image to your personal vision without a degradation in quality.<br><br>In particular, you can set white balance, contrast, saturation and sharpening to any value you desire in post-processing, allowing you to experiment and evaluate precisely the consequences of each decision. There is also much more leeway for exposure, with the ability to recover about half a stop of details in highlights and shadows compared to a jpg.<br><br>RAW files are much bigger than their equivalent jpg brothers, and they also come in proprietary formats - a source of big concern to many photographers. A standard exists, called DNG, and there are tools available to convert your raw files to DNG, but sadly, as of 2010, Pentax is the only major manufacturer to allow shooting directly in DNG.<br><br>Since the whole point of raw files is that they are not directly viewable, you will need dedicated software, called a raw converter. This can be a major hassle if the converter is not well integrated in your library software, but if you use modern software such as Adobe Lightroom or Apple Aperture, the raw conversion step should be perfectly transparent and will require no extra effort on your part. We will discuss these issues in more detail in a later lesson.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/19-03.jpg'/><br><br>Whether you should shoot raw or jpg is one of the big issues of digital photography, and very strong opinions exist on both sides. What it comes down to is what your ultimate goal is: if you need to produce volume and want to reduce post-processing time to a minimum, then well calibrated jpg should be satisfactory. If on the other hand you care about getting the best possible image quality and are willing to spend at least some time in front of a computer, then use raw.<br><br>I would go a little bit further, and advise any new photographer to shoot raw unless they have a good reason to use jpg. The big advantage is that, like with film negatives, you can always come back to your old files with new software, new experience and new vision and reprocess them to better results.<br><br>Generally speaking, it is well worth spending the time (and money) to learn how to incorporate raw into your image workflow (which, again, we will cover later)."

		content: "Until a couple of years ago, the debate was still raging: between the century old chemical process of film and the brand new digital sensors, which should one choose? Things have now settled, and the vast majority of photographers have made the switch to digital, relegating film to niche uses. There are still many compelling reasons to use film, though, if only for experimentation. We'll outline here some advantages and drawbacks of each medium.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/20-01.jpg'/><br><br>For digital:<br><br>Immediate feedback. More than anything else, this should be considered the main reason for the success of digital photography. By being able to see the image right away and examine focus and exposure, it is possible to reduce the number of catastrophic mistakes. It also makes experimenting and learning much easier, and this is why digital makes excellent first cameras for anybody.<br><br>It costs no money to take many pictures, encouraging to shoot more, experiment more and get mileage faster. Since the memory card can be reused and shutters are rated for several dozen thousands of uses, the cost of each picture is very close to zero, past the initial investment. As we will see in the film section, some would consider this a drawback.<br><br>Each memory card can contain hundreds, if not thousands of images, whereas film is limited to 36 exposures at most. Film is also impractical to transport in great quantities, being heavy and bulky, slow to switch in the camera, etc.<br><br>Dynamic ISO: the ability to modify ISO on the fly is a huge advantage over the static light response of film and offers a lot more versatility when light changes fast or unexpectedly.<br><br>Cataloging and editing are both much easier with digital files. Even though talented printers could do many things in a darkroom, it often required years of training and expensive equipment. For better or for worse, Photoshop has made all these manipulations accessible to everyone. It is possible to digitize film, but it requires many additional and time consuming steps, as well as a significant investment in scanning equipment.<br><br>Finally, all the development happens in digital nowadays, and all the new features are only available on digital bodies.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/20-02.jpg'/><br><br>For film:<br><br>The drawbacks of no immediate feedback and expensive, limited number of frames are sometimes considered as advantages: less distraction, more focus on images that really matter, forcing the photographer to pay more attention to his craft. For these reasons, a film camera can be a great learning tool to photographers who master the basics but want to push their art further.<br><br>Though the film itself is costly, we have decades worth of old bodies and lenses available at very low prices, since so few people shoot film anymore. Trying film photography for a little while doesn't have to be a big financial investment.<br><br>There are not very many exotic digital cameras, few manufacturers venture out of the compact - DSLR standards. Film, on the other hand, has all sorts of bizarre and fun cameras : medium format, large format, TLRs, rangefinders, holgas, etc. It can open new venues for experimentation and expressing your personal vision, or just growing as a photographer.<br><br>Though high-end digital has pretty much caught up, film still holds its own in image quality, in particular in terms of resolution and dynamic range (with negatives, slide film having a notoriously bad range).<br><br>The world of the darkroom, though quickly vanishing, is something wonderful. If you shoot black and white, you can fairly easily do your own printing, something which many people love and a very different way of relating, on an almost physical level, to your pictures.<br><br>Many old film bodies are refreshingly simple, with no gimmicks and very few controls - the Leica M and Nikon FM are perfect examples of this. Not only will you not depend on a battery, but you could learn a discipline of image making which has the potential of making you a much better photographer. In particular, it drives home the point that a camera is just a tool, something fancy DSLR makers want you to forget.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/20-03.jpg'/><br><br>In conclusion, there is definite answer. Little doubt remains that outside of niche uses, digital is more practical, cheaper and more useful than film. But using a film camera for a period of time could be a great learning tool. As an example, see the Leica year proposed by The Online Photographer a while back."

I have tried to present your different options for each situation in the most \"open\" way possible. Today's lesson will be a bit more subjective, as I will explain how I shoot, depending on the conditions, and explain my decision process for choosing each parameter. Of course, we are all different photographers, and I have little doubt that many people will have significantly different practices, so let's just be clear that this should not be considered as a gospel of any kind, but instead as an explanation of what works for me.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/21-01.jpg'/><br><br>Permanent settings<br><br>This is the stuff I (almost) never change:<br><br>Quality is always set to RAW. Since my camera embeds a full size jpg file in the metadata, there is no point in shooting raw+jpg. I will only shoot jpg for quick and dirty jobs, such as taking a product picture for ebay.<br><br>Since I shoot raw and post-process everything before publication, I set white balance to auto and forget about it.<br><br>For optimal evaluation of the raw file on the LCD, I set my jpg image profile to low contrast, low saturation, no sharpening and no noise reduction. It looks ugly out of the box, but is the most accurate.<br><br>The AE-L/AF-L is set either to AF-L (focus lock) or AF-ON (triggering autofocus, instead of using the traditional half-press of the shutter). I find that I rarely need exposure lock, and when I do, it is easy enough to go in manual mode.<br><br>The camera is permanently set on high-speed burst mode.<br><br>I disable some of the features of the camera: the annoying beep confirming focus and focus assist light, mostly.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/21-02.jpg'/><br><br>Normal conditions<br><br>Whenever shooting in a light that is not too extreme, I use the following settings:<br><br>ISO is set to the base value of 200. I disable Auto-ISO but have assigned one of the control wheels to modifying ISO.<br><br>I put the camera in Aperture Priority mode.<br><br>Unless I specifically want shallow depth of field, I use an aperture of f/8. If I want subject separation, I will go straight to the maximal aperture. I very rarely venture above f/11 to limit diffraction.<br><br>I always keep an eye on my shutter speed. I know that my threshold level with VR lenses is about 3 to 4 stops below the inverse focal length. Whenever I get close to that value, I will start by opening my aperture up to the maximal value. If that still isn't enough, I will increase ISO up to its maximal acceptable value, which on my D90 I have decided is approximately ISO 1200. If I still have too slow shutter speeds, I will take a burst of 3 or 4 frames and check on the LCD whether at least one is sharp.<br><br>My autofocus mode tends to stay on AF-C (continuous focus) and, depending on the complexity of the subject, I will either leave the camera choose the active AF sensor or, if there are two many possible planes of focus, I will select it manually and use focus and recompose with the AF-L button.<br><br>I use matrix metering in all but the most demanding light conditions. The Nikon version is especially good at detecting and exposing snow, which is very important to my mountain photography.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/21-03.jpg'/><br><br>Low light<br><br>When the light gets really too low, as discussed previously, I will in order open my aperture, increase the ISO and start taking multiple shots. When speeds reach unacceptable levels (1/4s or more), I will start looking for a stable platform or unfold my tripod. Some other things change as well:<br><br>Assuming I have found a stable enough platform (tripod or otherwise), I immediately put aperture and ISO back to their ideal values.<br><br>Depending on the subject, I might go into spot metering. I might also go into manual exposure mode if the results from the meter are too inconsistent.<br><br>Since autofocus doesn't work very well in low light, I will try to help it by going into single central AF-sensor and using focus and recompose. If it doesn't manage to obtain focus, I will switch to manual focus and possibly use the focus scale and hyperfocal distance.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/21-04.jpg'/><br><br>High contrast<br><br>High contrast light is very difficult to deal with. Since I don't carry grad ND filters, I have two options: either use autobracketing and HDR or decide to sacrifice either shadows or highlights.<br><br>High contrast light is easy to identify with the histogram: long bars on both edges mean the dynamic range of the camera is exceeded. If there is a bar on only one side, I will use exposure compensation until I get either a correct exposure or a confirmation of too high contrast.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/21-05.jpg'/><br><br>Once I have taken the image, and unless I am pressed for time, I will always review two things on the LCD screen: histogram and sharpness. I leave my review screen in the mode with a big histogram and a thumbnail image, as I rarely check my composition after taking the image, trusting I got it right in the viewfinder.<br><br>On my histogram, I mostly look for lost details, identified by a long bar on either edge. If there is one, I will look at the image and decide whether the details really matter. If they do, I will change my exposure compensation and reshoot. The other thing I am checking is whether the histogram is shifted too far to the left, in which case I will try to Expose To The Right and overexpose a little bit.<br><br>For sharpness, I simply zoom in at 100% and verify that there is no motion blur."

This is also the step where you should add relevant keywords to your images, to make it easy to find them again when the need arises. You can find a more detailed description of my workflow with Lightroom on this blogpost.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/22-02.jpg'/><br><br>Now that you have a fair idea of which photos you want to work on, you can begin the image editing proper. Again, there are many steps involved:<br><br>If you want to do any cropping, you should do so now, at the very start. This can either be reframing or changing aspect ratio and rotating the image to get a level horizon.<br><br>Some software, like Adobe Lightroom, provides different image profiles, matching the in-camera jpg processing. This should also be chosen at the beginning, along with lens corrections if needed.<br><br>Noise reduction is best applied early on, as it can produce artefacts if applied late in the workflow.<br><br>White balance is chosen at this stage if you shot in raw. jpg users can do minor adjustments but should restrain from big modifications.<br><br>Exposure and contrast are then adjusted, usually via either levels or curves, which we will cover in a later lesson.<br><br>Finally, saturation and midtone contrast are tweaked.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/22-03.jpg'/><br><br>At this point, you should have covered the basic image adjustments. Chances are that this will be enough for your purposes, though of course you can always do more:<br><br>Local adjustments are similar modifications to what we did earlier, except that they only affect part of the image. This is a very powerful tool, which we will talk about more in the \"levels and masks lesson\" in a few days.<br><br>You could apply a number of further effects here, including black and white conversion, toning, tonemapping, etc. Just remember that it's easy to go overboard, and that the effect should not be more important than the image itself...<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/22-04.jpg'/><br><br>Once you feel you are done editing, the last stage is publication, and exporting your image in a format that will fit the medium for which it is intended. There are three major steps:<br><br>Resizing. 900x750 is a common and useful size for online use, for instance, while printers will want 240 or 300dpi with the physical dimensions of the print.<br><br>Sharpening: this is best done last, after resizing and knowing how the image will be used. The point is not to remove motion blur but to accentuate the edges so that the image appears sharper to our eyes.<br><br>Colour profile conversion: this is a vast and complex subject, the details of which we will not discuss here. In a nutshell, every device displays colours differently, and using the right profile helps said device in showing the image accurately - as the photographer intended. The bottom line is: for web, convert to sRGB, for print use AdobeRGB."

But of course, we still need to index and label our images, just as before, or it will be just as impossible to find an old image as it was in the days of film.<br><br>Any photographer who has been shooting for a while will have dozen of thousands of images in his library, sometimes hundreds of thousands. My library shows 42,000, and I have only been at it since 2006. That's a lot of photos. If you don't organize your library, and if you don't do it early, you will have an impossible mess on your hands.<br><br>The whole process of organizing your images and other multimedia files in something relatively sane bears the somewhat pompous name of Digital Asset Management (DAM). You will have to pay attention to it, sooner or later, so the earlier you organize yourself, the easier and less time consuming it will be.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/23-01.jpg'/><br><br>There are two basic solutions for DAM: you can either try to manage things manually via a carefully crafter folder structure, or you can use dedicated software to hold your library. In the past few years, advanced software such as Adobe Lightroom, Apple Aperture and Bibble Pro have been released, which integrate every step of the digital workflow in a single interface. They are by far the easiest and most efficient solution. I don't want to sound like a billboard, but there is little doubt in my mind that buying Lightroom would be some of the best money you spend on photography.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/23-02.jpg'/><br><br>There are a few important concepts in DAM:<br><br>You should organize your files in a well defined, well thought-out structure. A very popular way of doing this is simply by date: all files shot today would go in the folder 2010/2010-09-17. Filenames are also important, I name mine by date and location, which would give 20100917-copenhagen-001.nef for instance. This should be done regardless of how your library software shows the files, as it is an insurance you can find your files even if you are unable to launch the software, for a reason or another.<br><br>You should use metadata. The camera will automatically record shooting parameters (in the EXIF tags) but you should add further information indicating both information on the content of the image (location, subject, style, etc) and the current \"status\" of the image, whether it is marked as being fully processed, waiting for editing, scheduled for further look, archived for future use, to be removed, etc. Doing this early will allow you to search through old images quickly.<br><br>Another important concept is to use non-destructive editing. This means that you are never overwriting the original file and always have the ability to go back to earlier stages of the edit process. NDE is built-in in software like Lightroom but you need to be careful if you use photoshop or similar applications. Either keep an untouched bottom layer (see a later lesson for more on layers) or, better, always work on a copy of the image, never on the original. Your style, your tastes, your skills and your software will all evolve in time, and you will want to go back to old photos and correct some of your editing.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/23-03.jpg'/><br><br>The other major component of DAM is backups. As the saying goes, everybody needs to go through one major dataloss before getting serious about backing up. Just make sure it doesn't happen to your most important images.<br><br>The truth is, nobody knows how to store digital files for a long period. Optical media (CDs and DVDs) only last a few years at best. Hard drives fail all the time, often with no warnings. Tape backups are better but still do not last forever. Storing files on the cloud (Amazon S3, dropbox and similar services) works well but still doesn't scale to the many GB of digital photographs. And of course, even immortal media wouldn't survive fire, flood or accidental erasure. For these reasons, the basic rule is to have multiple copies of your important files (raw and processed versions of your best images at the very least) and to store them in different locations. 3 copies in 2 locations is a good basic practice.<br><br>You need to backup at both ends of the workflow pipeline:<br><br>At the very start, just after you shot them, your images are very vulnerable. They all live on a tiny piece of plastic and there is a single copy in the whole known universe. If you accidentally format the card, lose it or suffer from memory corruption, it is gone forever. For this reason, you should try to make an additional copy as soon as possible - usually, this means downloading the card on a computer disk. You should immediately make another copy to a secondary drive, as otherwise, you would find yourself with a single copy again as soon as you reformat the card. Ideally, you would make an off-site copy, but it is rarely feasible.<br><br>At the other end, once you are done editing, you will want long term storage. This is when you really need off-site copies. With the low cost of hard drives, the cheapest and easiest way to achieve this is by putting your entire collection on a portable disk and hand it to friends or family, syncing your collection every time you visit them (hopefully every few weeks). Of course, don't forget to renew the disk every couple of years, as they don't last forever.<br><br>Backing up is a costly operation and a major hassle, but you will be glad you did, sooner or later. The only question is whether you have to lose important data before you realise this (I did)."

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "In this lesson, we will discuss what is, by far, the most important and powerful tool you can use to post-process an image: curves. With it alone, you can do maybe 50% of all your editing. Throw in a basic knowledge of layers and masks, which we will talk about tomorrow, and this climbs to something like 80% (disclaimer: these figures were made up on the spot).<br><br>Even though curves are relatively straightforward, there is a simplified version of the tool which, while losing some power, is often sufficient: levels.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/24-03.jpg'/><br><br>Levels and curves modify exposure and, by extension, contrast. In order to be used effectively, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the histogram.<br><br>Let's talk about levels first. As you may remember, we said in the histogram lesson that a \"perfect\" histogram is one which has a bell shape, tapering off in both directions and ending exactly at the edges, which correspond to pure white and pure black. You don't want it to end after the right edge, for instance, because it would mean that you are losing information and getting pure white, and you don't want it to end before the right edge because it means that there are no really bright values in the image, which will make it appear dull and washed-out, lacking contrast.<br><br>If you were careful about your exposure, your histogram should be on the conservative side, to avoid losing details. This means that the histogram is \"too small\" and doesn't touch the edges: the image looks a bit dull, without much contrast. In a word, it doesn't \"pop\"!<br><br>What levels does is resize the box, so that your histogram fits into it perfectly. It looks like on the following image (this comes from the Gimp, but Photoshop or countless other applications will be similar). There are three controls: black, grey and white points. Let's forget about grey for now and concentrate on black and white. If you slide them around, they will define the new edges of the box in which the histogram lives.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/24-01.png'/><br><br>One intuitive way to think about it is the following: imagine that the histogram is a bit spring (or a bit of jelly). When you move the black point to the right, it will be attached to the left edge of your spring. Then when you apply the levels tool, the black point goes back to the left edge where it started, bringing with it the histogram, thus deforming it to fit the box better. Of course, the white point does the same thing on the other side.<br><br>Concretely, what you should do 95% of the time is simply to drag the black point to the leftmost part of the histogram which contains something, and the white one to the rightmost part. Once you apply the tool, you will have a perfectly shaped histogram, with just a touch of pure black and pure white, but no lost information.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/24-06.jpg'/><br><br>Ok, but what about the grey point? Its action is simple: it will also deform the histogram, but instead of affecting the edges, it has to do with the balance between highlights and shadows. If you drag it to the right then apply the levels tool, it will also return to its position in the middle, taking with it the histogram. This will compress the shadows and expand the highlights, thus darkening the image. Similarly, shifting it to the left will brighten the image, since it gives more importance to the highlights.<br><br>The grey point is very useful for a simple reason: it doesn't touch the edges. So with it, you can modify the overall brightness of your image without ever having to worry about whether you are losing any information to pure white or pure black.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/24-04.jpg'/><br><br>Useful as it may be, the levels tool has two important limitations: it only provides three points of reference (black, grey and white), and it is impossible to control how it deforms the histogram. This makes it suitable for \"high level\" manipulations, but not for fine-grained ones. This is where curves will be useful. See an example of the interface here:<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/24-02.png'/><br><br>Like levels, curves will remap brightness values (i.e. they will say \"all pixels with brightness 127 should now have brightness 135\" and so on), but they do so much more explicitly. It works in the following way: for each value on the horizontal axis, modify its brightness to the value on the vertical axis to which the curve makes it match. This means that if your curve is a perfect diagonal (what you always start with), there is no modification. If the curve is below the diagonal, you are darkening the image. If it is above the diagonal, you are brightening it.<br><br>So far, so good. Where this becomes really interesting is when you are mixing both. A typical curve will have an S shape: the shadows will be darkened and the highlights brightened. In other words, you are increasing contrast. By choosing where the S intersects the diagonal and how deep the bends are, you can very precisely modify contrast and brightness. You can also make modifications to only the brightness values you are interested in while leaving the others untouched. The possibilities are nearly endless.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/24-05.jpg'/><br><br>Another interesting way to use both levels and curves is with the eyedropper tool. In levels, this will allow you to select directly on the image what should be pure white and pure black. In curves, it will do no modification but will simply place a control point on the curve corresponding to the exact brightness of the pixel under the cursor. You then simply have to move the point up or down to modify the brightness of this area of the image."

		sectionType: "tuto",
		content: "Along with levels and curves, layers and masks are some of the most important concepts in image editing. They hold the key to two crucial features: localized adjustments and non-destructive editing.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/25-01.jpg'/><br><br>Layers and masks are a fairly simple idea. Imagine the following situation: you have adjusted the histogram so that it touches the edges perfectly, but you still aren't satisfied: the mountain in the background looks too dark. However, your hands are tied, as the bright sky is just perfect. If you increase brightness even a little bit, it will go into pure white. What you need is a way to modify only part of the image.<br><br>Now imagine that you print your original image. You then use the levels tool and increase brightness so that the mountains are just right, burning the sky in the process. You make another print of this new version.<br><br>Now comes the trick: you position the new print above the old one. Then you take a pair of scissors and cut out the sky in the new image, uncovering the bottom image. Finally, paste the top print (minus sky) on top of the bottom one: your new image now has correct exposure everywhere.<br><br>Of course, it would be extremely cumbersome to do this with physical prints, but this is exactly what is going on when you use layers in photoshop: you have duplicated the bottom layer (made a print copy), modified the top layer with the levels tool then applied a mask (cut out with scissors) and finally merged the two layers (glued them together).<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/25-02.jpg'/><br><br>Things are actually even better than that. Scissors are a pretty limited tool, they only create two states, cut out or left in, and there is a sharp delimitation between the two. Layer masks, on the other hand, can have soft (feathered) transitions and semi-transparency, showing part of each layer.<br><br>The way it works is that a mask is a greyscale image. White represents showing all of the layer, while black shows none. So a layer with a pure white mask shows entirely, while a pure black mask acts as if the layer didn't exist at all. 50% grey would show half of the top layer and half of the bottom one, etc.<br><br>Whenever you create a new mask for a layer, you always start with pure white. You can then paint over the mask with a grey or black brush, revealing more and more of the bottom layers. If you use a hard brush, there will be sharp transitions, while soft brushes will tend to produce more natural looking results.<br><br>Creating a mask can be a very time consuming task, but attention to details will be crucial if you want your editing to not be obvious.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/25-03.jpg'/><br><br>So far, the layers we have used have been bitmap layers: each layer is a full size image. There is however another type, called adjustment layer (note that this is one of the big lacks of Gimp compared to Photoshop). They work by simply storing what transformation should be applied on the layers below. For instance, instead of duplicating the bottom layer and applying levels, the software will simply remember \"move the white point 20 steps to the left and the black slider 15 points to the left\".<br><br>This has two significant advantages. First, it dramatically reduces the file size (and thus the responsiveness of the application) since you don't have to store a full size image for each layer. Second and more important, it allows you to change the adjustment at any point. If after making many other modifications you suddenly decide that you would rather have the black slider 10 points to the left instead of 15, you can change this easily instead of having to start from scratch again. This also means that you can work entirely non-destructively if you use only adjustment layers. To recover the initial image before any editing, simply hide all layers but the bottom one.<br><br>For both reasons, you should take the good habit of always using adjustment layers for all your work."

Much more important, though, is the creative side - having something to say and expressing it through an image. This will be the subject of our last four lessons.<br><br>Entire treaties have been written on the surprisingly complex subject of how to arrange elements inside the frame. Studying them can prove useful, especially for the more analytically minded among us, while others might simply prefer to observe the works of the masters of photography or painting.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/26-01.jpg'/><br><br>Here are some of the most common \"rules\" of composition:<br><br>The rule of thirds affirms that putting the subjects slightly off the centre will make the image more dynamic. Some argue that better results can be achieved when using the golden ratio (1.618), rather than 1/3, but the jury is still out.<br><br>Judicious use of colour and light directs attention toward the subject. Contrasting colours attracts the eye. So do bright areas, which explains why a common processing trick is to add extra vignetting (darkening of the edges), to direct the viewer to the centre of the frame.<br><br>Strong shapes, especially triangles and diagonal lines, look dynamic and direct the eye. Positioning the subject at the intersection of strength lines is a powerful method of attracting attention to it. Using natural frames (tree branches, arches, etc) also works well.<br><br>The edges of an image are a sensitive area, and there shouldn’t be anything too prominent there, lest the eye be tempted to wander off. Cut-off objects are also to be avoided.<br><br>Out of focus backgrounds are important. They should contribute to the story but not steal the show. The focus should point to the important parts of the image.<br><br>Whenever a subject is moving or looking in a direction, there should be plenty of space in the image to allow the viewer to participate. For instance, if a hiker is walking toward the right, he should positioned close to the left edge.<br><br>The simpler the composition, the stronger the image. Complexity is distracting. An ideal image has all the elements needed to understand the story and nothing more. To quote Thoreau: “Simplify, simplify!”.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/26-02.jpg'/><br><br>This list is pretty standard. You will find some version of it in half of the photography books you can pick up at the library. Its usefulness should not be overestimated, though. While it can be used as a checklist and will occasionally help you make a decision, it can’t be a recipe for good composition, and exceptions tend to be almost as numerous as good examples. They are not really rules, and could better be described as “properties shared more often than not by images generally judged as good” (though something has to be said for brevity...).<br><br>More importantly, through experience, shooting thousands of images and seeing thousands more, both good and bad, you will develop instincts of what, to you, constitutes a good image. Rarely does a photographer consciously think “I should position my subject at the intersection of those strength lines”, he will just know to do it and maybe, afterwards, realize that his image works because of it. In this sense, the list given higher may be more useful to the art critic than to the photographer, though to the beginner who hasn’t yet seen and shot enough to have gained this instinctive knowledge, it can be an adequate replacement.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/26-03.jpg'/><br><br>Disclaimer: Today's lesson is adapted from a chapter of my book, Remote Exposure."

Its message can be summarised in the following way: learn the rules, follow them, master them and then break them when you need to.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/27-01.jpg'/><br><br>In each past lesson, rules for what is generally considered \"good\" photography have been presented. They range from what a correct exposure should be to how to arrange elements in the frame. They are however mere suggestions, recipes which tend to produce acceptable results in the greatest number of cases.<br><br>Not only should you feel free to break these rules, but you should actually feel obligated to do so. Not all of them, and not all the time, but experimenting and pushing the boundaries is the most efficient (and sometimes only) way to become better at something. It is especially true of art, which includes photography.<br><br>For experimentation to be fruitful, however, you need to evaluate your results. You need to take the time to review your images afterward and to judge what worked and what didn't. You can then either decide that the old rule was there for a reason, or you can decide to make new rules for yourself, because you find that they work better than the old ones. Of course, in due time, you will also break those. Never stop learning.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/27-02.jpg'/><br><br>There is a caveat, however. Your rule breaking should always be there for a reason. It should enhance your message, help you to better communicate whatever it is you are trying to say with your images. Breaking rules just for the sake of breaking rules is just a gimmick, an effect that will take over the attention which should be reserved for the subject matter.<br><br>The corollary of this is that you should only break rules once you have learned and mastered them. It is very important to understand why they exist and why they are generally considered good.<br><br>To take an example, if you don't understand why people compose with the rule of thirds, then you won't realise that breaking it and putting your subject dead centred is a way to suggest symmetry and harmony.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/27-03.jpg'/><br><br>This is why, even if you only shoot centred subjects in high key with motion blur introduced by low shutter speeds (which I guess would be a personal style), time spent mastering proper exposure and composition will be well spent.<br><br>Take Martin Parr. He belongs to the very prestigious Magnum agency, had major solo exhibits and published countless books. His particular style is quite special, using on camera flash and what would be considered poor composition. In many cases, his photos could be mistaken from tourist snapshots on flickr. Yet they are great art and are justly celebrated, because he uses these imperfections to tell us something (about ourselves and about our societies). And there is no doubt that he could take a greatly exposed, greatly lit, greatly composed image any time he wants to."

More than luck, raw talent, hard work, experience or equipment, what really made a difference was that the photographer deeply cared about the image. The creator of the piece had something to say, and photography was how he chose to express it. It may not have been the immediate subject that the artist really cared about (I doubt Edward Weston was that passionate about peppers), but, at some level, there is a message in each of those timeless photographs. In a way, this is almost a tautology: a good photograph is one that is inspiring, and it can’t be inspiring to viewers if it hadn’t been to the photographer when he pressed the shutter. If you want to create powerful images, the first and most important step is simply to care. You need to have something to say, and you need to try and express it through your photography.<br><br>Every time you are about to take a picture, ask yourself how the scene you are photographing makes you feel, and whether the image you are about to create is the best way to express that feeling. Are you awed, amused, scared? Is this a tale of suffering, of conquest, of brotherhood, of humility?<br><br>Just remember this: if you don’t care about your subject, why should any viewer? And deeper even, if you don’t care about your subject, why would you care about producing a good photograph of it?<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/28-01.jpg'/><br><br>To illustrate this, here's a personal story. A few years ago, on a hike in Swedish Lapland, I saw a postcard with a waterfall in front of an easily recognizable mountain. As I walked back to camp, I happened to pass that very waterfall in similar lighting conditions. For some reason, I felt that I had to take the same picture. It turned out pretty well, and has had some success with viewers, but deep down, I have always hated it. It wasn’t mine, I wasn’t expressing anything with it. I have since deleted it from my portfolio and am not showing it anymore.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/28-02.jpg'/><br><br>So look into your soul. Find something that you care about, something that you want to share, something that makes you want to take your camera, your paintbrush or your pen and pursue it.<br><br>I don't like cars very much, and I have little interest in them. I find car photography rather boring, and I have no doubt that if I were to try and photograph cars, I would come back with poor images. Maybe they would be well exposed and well composed, but they would not stir anything in the viewers, simply because the subjects didn't stir anything in me.<br><br>On the other hand, climbing, especially in the big mountains, is my life. I have so much to say, so much to share about that wonderful experience that climbing a mountain is. And even when my pictures are badly exposed or blurry, they usually still have more soul than any photograph of a car I could ever take. And of course, to many people, mountaineering photos will look dull while anything with four wheels will make them salivate. This is fine (though they are wrong, but hey... ;) ).<br><br>The recipe is simple: photograph what you love."

For many, it is even why they decide to pick up a camera in the first place.<br><br>Sharing your work is also one of the most powerful learning tools out there. Not really because you get insightful criticism (though it does happen, it remains the exception more than the rule) but simply because it pushes you to give the best you can and makes you strive to get even better.<br><br>It is all to easy to have thousands of images lying in a dusty corner of a hard drive. To be honest, post-processing is often a bit of a dull job, and people often procrastinate it until a new photo session has replaced the old one. Before your realize it, you have a huge backlog of unprocessed images. Knowing that your work will be seen by others is a great motivation to process them and get them out there.<br><br>The good news is that with the internet, it has become extremely easy to share your images with the world. There are many online communities dedicated to just that, and of course photo hosting services like flickr . It is also possible to host your own website with great simplicity, using tools like pixelpost or even wordpress.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/29-02.jpg'/><br><br>All of these solutions allow viewers to comment on your images. Of course, getting feedback is great, but this can also be a dangerous thing. Not everybody is an art critic or even a photographer, so any advice should be taken with healthy circumspection. Raving compliments such as the ones often found on flickr, while certainly nice for the ego, bring little and can give you the impression that your work is perfect and that you don't need to improve it, a very dangerous attitude.<br><br>Another danger is the one of trends. If you are actively looking for positive comments, the easiest way is to follow whatever is hot at the moment: HDR, timelapse, faux-polaroid, vignetting effect, etc. More generally, it can be tempting to use a certain style or subject matter simply to better fit in in your community. The ultimate result is that your images will become generic and undistinguishable from the ones of the next guy.<br><br>This brings us to the second point of this lesson: while sharing your work is very important, you need to find a balance as to how much you let external criticism influence you. Not at all, and unless you are an art genius, you will keep repeating the same mistakes over and over without any way of getting out. If on the other hand you follow every advice given to you, you will add nothing personal to your images and will simply produce whatever the hivemind has decided it wanted this week.<br><br>The way of the artist is a difficult one - you must accept and listen to honest criticism while standing up for your work.

		content: "I'm afraid that this course has come to an end. We have covered everything that I would consider important for a newcomer in the field of photography to know. This is not to say that there is nothing left to learn, quite the opposite in fact. The question is: what now?<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/30-01.jpg'/><br><br>Assuming you have read, understood and practiced all the lessons, including the assignments when they exist, I see three possible paths:<br><br>You can consolidate your newly-acquired knowledge. Stop learning new stuff for a while and focus on mastering what you already know until it becomes second nature.<br><br>You can dive deeper into the topics we covered. In many cases, for instance post-processing, we only scratched the surface of what is possible. Exceptions to the rules, subtleties and other tricky cases were often omitted for the sake of brevity and clarity. You can choose to study any of these points in more details until you become an expert.<br><br>Finally, you can choose to expand your learning in new domains. There is a lot we haven't covered, for instance panorama, HDR, night photography, camera movements, black and white, infrared, fisheye, underwater, etc. Follow your interests or try something completely new, experiment, it's a vast world.<br><br>The good thing, of course, is that these options are not mutually exclusive. Whatever you end up choosing, I would urge you to spend time consolidating. At least 6 months, possibly more: it's all fine and well to read about stuff in a book or on reddit, and even to try it out a few times, but until you have shot thousands of frames, it won't really be part of you.<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/30-02.jpg'/><br><br>Which leaves the question of how. Listed in rough order of efficiency, here are some suggestions:<br><br>Shoot! Nothing can replace this. If you want to be good at taking pictures, you need to practice. A lot. All the time. Some people like self-assigned projects, others just shoot things as they come. Whatever works for you, be sure to close the books, leave your keyboard and go shooting.<br><br>Consider taking a workshop or a course. When they are well run, they are the fastest way to learn and can often give you an inspiration jolt. If you take one from a famous photographer, try to find online reviews from past participants first, as being a good photographer does not necessarily equate being a good teacher.<br><br>Interact with other photographers, either in real life or via online communities. Share your work, get feedback and exercise your critical eye by giving feedback to others. Just make sure you don't end up chasing the warm feeling of having people tell you you are great instead of striving to create better images. Also try not to be sucked in the endless gear discussions vortex that is sadly so common on many internet boards. People who spend their time there are usually the ones who don't shoot very much.<br><br>Some good places to start are flickr, 1x, naturescapes and photo.net but there are many, many, many others. Just find a friendly, not too gear obsessed place.<br><br>Read books on your favourite subject. Three publishers I can warmly recommend for their great quality (disclaimer: I am an author at two of them, but this is because I like them, not the other way around) are Craft and Vision, Rocky Nook and Peachpit. There are too many titles to mention here, but some books that have inspired me include Joe McNally's The Moment It Clicks and The Hot Shoe Diaries, David Ward's Landscape Within, Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography and the textbook Light Science and Magic.<br><br>Oh, and did I mention you should go out shooting?<br><br><img class='tutoimg' src='articles/img/30-03.jpg'/><br><br>I hope you enjoyed this course and learned a few things along the way. I really hope I managed to convince you that photography can be both simple and fun.<br><br>Finally, though my motivation for doing this course was simply to give back to the community, if it was useful to you and if you can afford it, a donation of any amount would be extremely appreciated. It will go straight into my savings in prevision of the day next year where I will try to become a full time climbing photographer. The paypal link is over there.<br><br>Alternatively, you can also help spread the word about my mountain photography and my books."
